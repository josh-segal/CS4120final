				<p>While the XML Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) was not designed as a query language, it is well-suited for many query-like operations on XML documents including selecting and restructuring data. Further, it actively fulfills the role of an XML query language in modern applications and is widely supported by application platform software. However, the use of database techniques to optimize and execute XSLT has only recently received attention in the research community. In this paper, we focus on the case where XSL transformations are to be run on XML documents defined as views of relational databases. For a subset of XSLT, we present an algorithm to compose a transformation with an XML view, eliminating the need for the XSLT execution. We then describe how to extend this algorithm to handle several additional features of XSLT, including a proposed approach for handling recursion.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>As XML has continued to gain popularity as a standard for information representation and exchange, tools to render and present XML are increasingly supported by common application platforms. Many of these tools implement a W3C standard, the XML Stylesheet Langauge <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This language is divided into transformation and formatting subsystems. As implied by the name, the transformation subsystem reorganizes the tree structure of an XML document and the formatting subsystem renders the result into a display format. In fact, the transformation sublanguage, appropriately called XML Stylesheet Language Transformations, or XSLT, has proven very popular with developers and is often implemented as a standalone tool. Some of the well-known implementations of XSLT are XT <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, SAXON <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and XALAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Common uses of XSLT include translating XML to HTML, and modifying or selecting part of an XML document. Unlike XQUERY <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, XSLT was not expressly designed as a query language. Nevertheless, XSLT can easily be used for "query-like" transformations. It also shares with XQUERY the use of XPATH <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for path evaluation. * Work performed while the author was visiting Bell Labs. † Work performed while the author was with Bell Labs.</p><p>Despite widespread use of XML standards for business data exchange, the vast majority of business data is stored and maintained by relational database systems. In fact, XML-publishing middleware technology, proposed by the research community <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, is rapidly being implemented by relational database vendors to ensure that XML-centric applications are well supported. Such middleware provides a declarative view query language with which to specify the desired mapping between the relational tables and the resulting XML document. Based on the mapping defined by the view query, a portion of the database can be exported as XML.</p><p>Given the respective importance of XML views and XSLT, it is important to propose efficient execution of XSLT stylesheets against XML-publishing views. A straightforward approach for accomplishing this would be to fully materialize the XML view as an XML document, upon which an XSLT stylesheet is evaluated.</p><p>This approach is problematic for large documents or complicated stylesheets, simply due to performance problems that commonly arise with XSLT evaluation on large documents. Recent work has explored optimizing the execution of XSLT transformations by incorporating XSLT processing into database query engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, even if XSLT evaluation can be made scalable and efficient, it may not be a good solution for XML documents published from relational database systems. For example, it is not actually necessary to materialize many of the nodes in the view query to produce the correct XSLT result document. First, node types not referenced by any XPATH expressions in the XSLT stylesheet need not be materialized. Similarly, nodes that do not match selection conditions in the appropriate XSLT templates are not useful. Finally, intermediate nodes along the XPATH expression need not be materialized if they are not part of the result.</p><p>These observations argue for a view composition approach to supporting XSLT in relational XML middleware. In this paper, we take the view composition approach and develop techniques that support execution of XSLT against XML-publishing views by first composing, as much as possible, the transformations in a stylesheet with a publishing view, resulting in a composed stylesheet view. Evaluating the stylesheet view on a database instance results in the same XML document that would be produced by evaluating the XSLT stylesheet on the original XML view. The stylesheet view does not generate the unnecessary nodes described above, promising improved efficiency. In addition, this approach removes the cost of parsing and XSLT processing. Rather, the XSLT processing is pushed into SQL queries processed by relational query engines. In fact, such view composition algorithms have been designed for user <ref type="bibr">XQUERY</ref> or XPATH queries to be efficiently executed by XML publishing middlewares and relational engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. We argue that similar techniques should be developed with <ref type="bibr">XSLT.</ref> To accomplish this, we define a restrictive subset of XSLT that we term XSLT basic , and give an algorithm that can compose an XSLT basic stylesheet with an XML view definition to produce a new XML view definition, the stylesheet view. At a high level, the algorithm consists of three steps. First, a graph representing the processing done by the XML stylesheet is constructed. Second, this graph is combined with a graph representation of the XML view query by matching pairs of nodes from the two graphs in a manner similar to the creation of a cross-product automaton. Finally, the resulting graph is pruned to remove unnecessary nodes and modified to handle formatting instructions, producing the stylesheet view. An alternative to composing XSLT with view queries is to translate XSLT to XQUERY <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and then use techniques such as those proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to compose the resulting XQUERY expression with the view query. While this approach is promising, we are not aware of any published techniques for performing this conversion, and it may introduce new complexities. Further, techniques developed in this paper (such as merging select-expressions with match-patterns) would apparently be required for such a conversion.</p><p>The only prior work of which we are aware on using SQL engines to execute a class of XSLT transformations is <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. While a detailed comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is deferred to Section 6, our approach differs in three key ways: 1) our algorithm produces an XML view query rather than an SQL query, 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> divides the XSLT transform into a set of paths and processes each separately, while our algorithm composes the stylesheet as a whole with the publishing query, and finally the extensions to our algorithm in Section 5 address features of XSLT such as priority that are not addressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>The focus of this paper is on the view-composition algorithm, rather than on optimization of either the composition algorithm or the resulting queries. We defer experimental evaluation and full consideration of optimized execution strategies for XSLT view composition queries to future research.</p><p>The outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the concepts and notions of XML publishing views and XSLT stylesheets. In Section 3, we overview the algorithm by describing the data structures generated in the four steps of the algorithm. In Section 4, we describe the details of the algorithm, and in Section 5, we describe how to extend the algorithm to handle more general XSLT stylesheets. Related work is discussed in Section 6, followed by our conclusion and a discussion of future work in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND</head><p>In this section, we briefly introduce XML-publishing views and XSLT stylesheets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Schema-Tree Queries</head><p>In this section, we introduce the notion of a view query in XMLpublishing middleware. SILKROUTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> defines XML views using RXL and queries them with XML-QL and XPERANTO <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> uses XQUERY. Throughout this paper, we use the view-query specification format as defined in ROLEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. This query format, referred to as a schema-tree query, is meant to capture a rich set of XML view queries, and is adapted from the intermediate query representation of SILKROUTE. While ROLEX focuses on a particular system architecture with tight integration between the application and the DBMS, our algorithm for composing XSLT with XML views does not rely on any particular features of ROLEX, and thus we expect it to be readily adaptable to other XML view languages. Details of schema-tree queries can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Below we briefly introduce schema-tree queries using a definition and an illustrative example. hotelchain(chainid, companyname, hqstate) metroarea(metroid, metroname) hotel(hotelid, hotelname, starrating, chain id metro id, state id, city, pool, gym) guestroom(r id, rhotel id, roomnumber, type, rackrate) confroom(c id, chotel id, croomnumber, capacity, rackrate) availability(a id, a r id, startdate, enddate, price)</p><p>Figure 2: Hotel reservation schema. Definition 1: A schema-tree query v is a set of nodes {ni}, each of which is a 6-tuple (id(ni), tag(ni), bv(ni), parameters(ni), Q bv(n i ) , children(ni)), where id(ni) is a unique identifier, tag(ni) is the tag, bv(ni) is the binding variable of ni, parameters(ni) is the set of parameters of Q bv(n i ) , which is the tag query of ni, and children(ni) is the set of child nodes of ni. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of schema-tree query that defines an XML view on the tables of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, in order to support conference planning by showing candidate hotels along with information about availability of rooms in the same metro area.</p><p>The id of a node is used to identify a node uniquely in v. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, there are two nodes that have the same tag &lt;confstat&gt;, but different ids, 2 and 4. Each tuple returned by the tag query Q bv(n i ) becomes an element in the resulting XML document with XML tag tag(ni); this element is said to have been generated by ni. For example, the node with id 1 in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> has associated with it the tag &lt;metro&gt; and the tag query "Qm = SE-LECT metroid, metroname FROM metroarea." This query defines a list of metropolitan areas that become sibling nodes in the resulting XML document, each tagged with the &lt;metro&gt; tag (a unique document root is implied). Relational attributes from the SELECT clause appear as XML attributes the generated element.</p><p>Tag queries may be parameterized by zero or more parameters, associated with binding variables. We refer to the query that defines binding variable bv(ni) as Q bv(n i ) , with parameters (ni) as the binding variables used in the body of the query. The binding variable bv(ni), a tuple variable ranging over the results of Q bv(n i ) , is used as a parameter when specifying the tag queries of descen-&lt;xsl:template match="pattern" mode=integer&gt; &lt;Result&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="expression"/&gt; &lt;/Result&gt; &lt;/xsl:template&gt;  dant nodes of ni. For example, the variable m associated with &lt;metro&gt; is used as a parameter in tag queries for &lt;hotel&gt; and &lt;metro available&gt; to refer to the attribute m.metroid.</p><p>The remainder of the view in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> defines the following. The tag query, Q h (m) for &lt;hotel&gt; is parameterized by the tuple variable m ranging over metropolitan areas and gives a list of hotels in that metropolitan area. The tag query, Q a (h), for &lt;ho-tel available&gt; counts available rooms at the given hotel in a certain fixed time period, whereas the tag query, Q v (m, a) for &lt;metro available&gt; counts the total available rooms in the entire metropolitan area for that same time period. In separate branches of the schema-tree, summary and detail information about conference rooms is given by the nodes with tags &lt;confstat&gt; and &lt;conf-room&gt; respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">XSLT</head><p>In this section, we briefly introduce XSLT, show how stylesheets are modeled, and introduce a working example.</p><p>Definition 2: An XSLT stylesheet x is a set of template rules {ri}, each of which is a 4-tuple (match(ri), mode(ri), priority(ri), output(ri)), where match(ri) is the match pattern of ri, mode(ri) is the mode of ri, priority(ri) is the priority of ri, and output(ri) is the output-tree fragment of ri.</p><p>The skeleton of a template rule is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>, and an example stylesheet in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>, which contains four template rules R1 through R4. The match pattern of a template rule, match(ri), is a pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and is essentially a subset of XPATH path expressions containing only child, descendant ("//"), and attribute axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For example, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>, match(R2) is "metro". The mode of a rule, mode(ri), is a symbol that allows rules to be partitioned; that is, rule invocations must match in mode as well as match pattern. If there is no mode attribute, the XSLT processor will set it to be a default value. Similarly the priority of a rule, priority(ri), is an integer, used in conflict resolution and is briefly discussed in Section 2.2.1. The output tree fragment for a rule, output(ri) controls the structure of a rule's output. For (R2) of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>, the output tree fragment consists of the &lt;re-sult metro&gt; tag and its contents. output(ri) may contain a set of &lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt; nodes, apply(ri) = {aj}, as defined below.</p><p>Definition 3: An apply-templates node, aj , is a 2-tuple of the form (select (aj ), mode(aj)), where select (aj) is the select expression of aj, and mode(aj) is the mode of aj.</p><p>select (aj) is a subset of XPATH expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> intended to ensure that results of the expression are nodes rather than atomic values. In (R2) of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>, there is only one apply-templates node and its select expression is "hotel/confstat". mode(aj) limits the rules which may match as described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">XSLT Processing Model</head><p>Basic XSLT processing consists of context transitions from a given XML document context node to a new context node recursively, starting from the root as the original context node, concatenating results in traversal order. This is shown as a function PROCESS in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>. Context transition is realized by two functions, MATCH and SELECT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>For an XML document context node dcon and a rule ri, the function MATCH (dcon , ri) returns true if match(ri) matches some suffix of the incoming path from the document root to dcon . The semantics of a select expression is a function SELECT . For an XML document node dcon matched by a rule ri and an apply-templates node aj ∈ ri, SELECT (dcon , aj) returns a set of nodes selected by select (aj), with dcon as the document context node.</p><p>In step 3 of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>, the algorithm checks that mode(ri) is the desired mode and that MATCH (dcon , ri) returns true. If multiple rules match (step 2), the XSLT processor employs a conflict detection and resolution scheme that applies only the rule with the highest priority <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Once a rule is activated, then, in steps 4-10 dcon is used to instantiate output(ri) to construct the resulting document fragment. select (aj) evaluated on dcon results in a node set Dnew con. The apply-templates nodes aj ∈ apply(ri) are replaced with the concatenation of resulting document fragments produced by recursively processing each node dnew con ∈ Dnew con with mode(ri) as the desired mode. Therefore the result of executing stylesheet x on XML document d is PROCESS (x, root, 0), where root is the root node of d.</p><p>In XSLT, there are special template rules called built-in template rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> which cause the input document to be copied to the output. In all examples (including <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4)</ref>, we list all template rules that will be processed and the reader should assume that built-in rules have been overridden.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">XSLT basic</head><p>We first develop an algorithm to process a subset of XSLT, that we call XSLT basic , which has the following restrictions on XSLT: (1) no type-coercion, (2) no document order, (3) no recursion, (4) no predicates, (5) no flow-control elements, (6) no conflict resolution for template rules, i.e., no conflicting rules, (7) no functions and aggregations, and (8) no variables and parameters, (9) no use of the descendent (//) axis, (10) select attribute of &lt;value-of&gt; or &lt;copy-of&gt; element can only be "." or an attribute "@attribute".</p><p>Refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for details of (1)-(9). Restriction (10) is related to the simple model of output formatting used in this paper in which Function PROCESS (x, dcon , mode) Input: XSLT stylesheet as x, Context document node as dcon , Desired mode of the matched rule as mode Output: XML document fragment as result 1: result ← empty 2: for ri ∈ x in decreasing order of priority(ri) do 3: if mode(ri) = mode and MATCH (dcon , ri) then 4:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">result ← output(ri) 5:</formula><p>for aj ∈ apply(ri) do 6:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Dnew con ← SELECT (dcon , aj) 7:</formula><p>sub result ← empty 8:</p><p>for dnew con ∈ Dnew con do 9:</p><p>sub result ← concatenate(sub result , PROCESS (x, dnew con , mode(aj))) 10:</p><p>Replace aj in result with sub result 11:</p><p>return result values produced from the database always appear as attributes of a node. We do not consider document order in this paper and consider it part of future work. In Section 5, we extend our algorithms to process supersets of XSLT basic that include <ref type="formula">(4)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(6)</ref>. We believe the resulting subset of XSLT will cover a reasonable variety of XSLT stylesheets applied to XML-publishing views, but plan to extend the fragment we cover in future work. Finally in Section 5, we propose by example an approach for handling recursion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">ALGORITHM OVERVIEW</head><p>Given a schema-tree query v and an XSLT basic stylesheet x, our algorithm generates a new schema-tree query v 񮽙 (called a stylesheet view), ensuring that for any relational database instance I, the result of query v 񮽙 on I is the same as the result of running x on the result of query v on I, i.e. v 񮽙 (I) = x(v(I)). The complete algorithm is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>. In this section, we introduce the key data structures and functions used in view composition. A detailed description of the algorithm appears in Section 4.</p><p>For schema-tree query v and XSLT stylesheet x, our algorithm begins by generating a context transition graph (CTG). This graph (a) combines the selecting and matching steps in XSLT processing, and (b) captures the context transitions that occur when evaluating x on a document produced by v. From the CTG, a traverse view query (TVQ) is generated, which by definition is a schematree query. The TVQ captures the traversal actions of x on v. The final step of our algorithm generates output tag trees that are combined with the TVQ to generate the output stylesheet view, v 񮽙 .</p><p>In this section, we introduce the above structures and describe how these structures relate to XSLT processing. A detailed description of the steps to generate the CTG, TVQ, and stylesheet view are given in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Context Transition Graph (CTG)</head><p>The context transition graph for an XSLT basic stylesheet x executed on a schema-tree query v, CTG(v, x), is a multigraph with a set of nodes M and a set of edges E. Each node m ∈ M , is annotated by a pair (n, r), where n is a node in the schema-tree query v and r is an XSLT basic template rule in x. The CTG for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, where we use (id(n), tag (n)) to represent the node n. (Although id(n) can identify a node n uniquely, the redundant tag (n) eases presentation.) Intuitively, the existence of a node (n, r) in CTG means that one or more of the XML document nodes generated by node n may be matched by rule r. An edge, say e = ((n 񮽙 , r 񮽙 ), (n, r), aj ), incoming to this node indicates that the firing of rule r 񮽙 on a document node d generated by n 񮽙 , might lead to one or more document nodes generated by n appearing in select (aj) for some aj ∈ apply(r 񮽙 ). (Since this may be true for multiple apply-template nodes, CTG(v, x) is a multigraph.) Associated with each edge is a tree-pattern query, smt (e), referred to as the select-match subtree for e. Intuitively, smt(e) combines the select-expression of aj with the match-pattern of r, and is produced by the function COMBINE , described in Section 3.5.</p><p>The left-hand side of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the CTG produced while composing the stylesheet shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> with the schema-tree query of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (the right-hand side of this figure is discussed in Section 3.5). Consider edge e2; this edge is present because applying the select expression "hotel/confstat" which appears in rule R2 to a document node produced by the metro node (id=1) in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1</ref> can potentially lead to nodes produced by the confstat node (id=4) being matched against rule R3. Note that, while <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> is a simple path, CTGs for XSLT basic stylesheets are actually directed acyclic multigraphs, and can be general multigraphs if recursion is allowed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Traverse View Query (TVQ)</head><p>The traverse-view query is a schema-tree query produced from the CTG. Intuitively, the nodes in the TVQ will generate those document nodes that may become context nodes during stylesheet evaluation. In this sense, it supports the traversal of the original XML document by the XSLT basic stylesheet. One or more nodes appear in the traverse-view query for each node in the context transition graph from which it is generated, with nodes being duplicated so that each node has a single incoming edge. The tree-pattern query of smt (e), where e = ((n1, r1), (n2, r2), a), in the context transition graph, is translated into a tag query in the query node associated with (n2, r2). The TVQ of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>(a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Output Tag Tree (OTT)</head><p>The  generate the expected output. To produce output, for each node (n, r) in the traverse view query, we generate an output tag tree t corresponding to r. The output tag trees for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>(b). We connect all the output tag trees to form a single output tag tree. The details about how the trees are generated and connected are discussed in Section 4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Stylesheet View</head><p>Combining the traverse view query and output tag trees, we generate the stylesheet view v 񮽙 for the XSLT stylesheet, as is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>(c). The combination entails copying the tag query for each node (n, r) in the traverse view query into the root of the output tag tree for (n, r). This is discussed in Section 4.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Functions Used in Composition</head><p>SELECTQ and MATCHQ are analogous to SELECT and MATCH presented in Section 2.2.1, but they operate on schematree nodes rather than data nodes. Recall that both SELECT and MATCH involve applying patterns to context nodes, either to derive a set of new context nodes or to determine whether the context nodes are matched. Correspondingly, when we apply a pattern abstractly on a schema-tree query, there is a query context node, and a new query context node. For example, we might apply the pattern "hotel/confstat" abstractly to the query context node (1, metro) in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> and determine that node (4, confstat) is a new query context node. We also introduce a third function, COMBINE , which produces the select-match subtrees associated with each edge in the CTG.</p><p>Given query node n and rule r, MATCHQ(n, r) checks if the template path match(r) matches some suffix of the path from the root to n in the schema-tree query. In XSLT, the match(r) contains only child or descendant ("//") axis location steps. Since XSLT basic does not have the descendant axis, any match will correspond to a unique, simple path in the schema-tree query. If such a path exists, it is returned as a tree-pattern query, otherwise NULL is returned. As a result, if dcon is an instance of n, MATCH (dcon , r) returns true if MATCHQ(n, r) returns a non-NULL value. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, there is a node ((5, confroom), R4), and match(R4)="metro/hotel/confroom". <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> shows the corresponding tree-pattern query, which has three nodes.</p><p>Given query nodes n1 and n2, rule r, and &lt;apply-templates&gt; element a ∈ apply(r), SELECTQ(n1, a, n2) returns a tree-pattern query in which n1 is the query context node and n2 is the new query context node, or NULL. The tree-pattern query (if one is returned) is derived from select (a) by using n1 as the context node and associating n2 with the final selection-step in select (a). With selection step axes limited to &lt;child&gt; and &lt;parent&gt;, the resulting treepattern will be unique. For example, if a is the apply-templates element in R3, then select (a)= "../hotel available/../confroom" and the corresponding tree-pattern query is the one shown in the top left <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>.</p><p>Given the tree-pattern query t returned from SELECTQ and the tree-pattern query p returned from MATCHQ, COMBINE creates a combined tree-pattern query as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>. To accomplish this, the two patterns are combined into a new pattern which is turned into a tree by a simple unification process, as follows. First, the node marked 'new query context node' in t and the node marked 'query context node' in p are unified. (Unification succeeds if the two nodes have the same ids.) If parents of the nodes just-unified exist in both queries, they are unified, and this process is repeated as many times as possible. Note that since both t and p are obtained from the schema-tree query, the result of this process will be a tree. Obviously, the function will fail if the initial unification fails, but as COMBINE is used in this paper, they are guaranteed to be the same schema-tree node.</p></div>

Further query transformations like those described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> can be applied to this query. Since the procedure is essentially to remove the binding variables in tag queries, it is named the UNBIND function.</p><p>As an example, the select-match subtree smt(e2) in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> is translated into an SQL query as follows. It is generated by unbinding the tag query Q s (h) of node &lt;confstat&gt; (with id 4), which is the new query context node in smt. All occurrences of binding variable $h in Q s (h) are replaced with references to a sub-query, the tag query Q h (m). Since &lt;metro&gt; is the lowest common ancestor of query context node &lt;metro&gt; and new query context node &lt;confstat&gt;, the unbinding stops. The resulting unbound query is shown below: Function UNBIND(m, n) Input: Query context node as m, Target node to unbind as n Output: Unbound query for n as q 1: nj ← the lowest common ancestor of m and n 2: sj ← bv(nj ) 3: childn (nj ) ← child node of nj along the path from nj to n 4: sj−1 ← bv(childn(nj ))</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">5: q ← Q s 1 ,s 2 ,..,s j−1 bv(n) (sj, ..., s 񮽙 k )</formula><p>, which is the unbound tag query of n, Q bv(n) (s1, s2, ..., s k ) 6: return q  This query becomes the tag query of ((4, confstat), R3) as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>(a), after the following transformation: the binding variable $m in the above query is renamed as $m new, which is the binding variable of ((1, metro), R2). Note that a GROUP BY clause on all columns of TEMP are added into the query by unbinding to preserve the semantics of the aggregation SUM (capacity) in Q s (h).</p><p>Another example of this process is the query for smt (e3) in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 6</ref>. The result of unbinding as described so far is shown here:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">SELECT * FROM confroom WHERE chotel_id=$h.hotelid</formula><p>However, this query is incorrect due to three subtle issues. First, the select-expression for smt (e3) is "../hotel available/../confroom", so there must exist at least one &lt;hotel available&gt; node, but the unbound query above does not check for one. Second, such a &lt;hotel available&gt; node is not arbitrary, but must be a sibling node of the &lt;confstat&gt; node with the same parent. In case of a missing &lt;hotel available&gt; sibling, the XSLT stylesheet would not process the &lt;confroom&gt;. Third, in a more complex pattern &lt;hotel available&gt; may itself be the root of a subtree, requiring that the process be carried out recursively. To handle these three issues (existence, sibling and recursion conditions), the procedure of generating the query for select-match subtree smt is modified as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. We introduce a new function NEST <ref type="figure">(Fig- ure 11</ref>) that is invoked from the procedure.

The unbound query involves every node along the path from childn (nj ) to n, which we denote as nodeset (childn (nj ) → n). The existence of every node along the path from nj to m, denoted as nodeset (nj → m), is ensured because of the existence of m itself. Therefore, we need to ensure that for every node in the set (nodeset (smt ) \ (nodeset (nj → m) ∪ nodeset (childn (nj ) → n))), there should exist at least one matching document instance node. For a node p ∈ nodeset (childn (nj ) → n), the existence of child nodes of p is checked by the EXISTS clause inserted at line 4 of NEST . Nesting is performed recursively for the nodes in the subtree under p. Similarly, for the child nodes (and the subtrees rooted at them) of nodes in nodeset (nj → m), EXISTS clauses are inserted at lines 10-11 of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>.

Morever, entries are inserted for schema-tree query nodes along the path childn (nj ) → n, such that the binding variables of these nodes in the original schema-tree query are mapped to bv((n, r)). In the tag query for each node (n, r) in the TVQ, the referenced binding variables are renamed according to bvmap((n, r)).</p></div>

The output tag trees for nodes in the TVQ of Figure 7(a) are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14</ref>, and the final output tag tree is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7(b)</ref>.

For a node (n, r), ott((n, r)) is the tree representation of the hypertext fragment inside the template rule r. We add a root pseudo-root to the fragment. The element &lt;xsl:valueof select="."&gt; in r, is represented as a node with the tag n, for example the &lt;confroom&gt; node in ott((5, confroom), R4)). Each &lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt; element in r is represented as an apply-templates node in ott((n, r)). Not shown are &lt;xsl:valueof select="@attribute"&gt; elements which would cause data from the database to be attached to a node like &lt;result-confstat&gt;.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Connecting the Output Tag Trees</head><p>The output tag trees of the nodes in the TVQ are connected to form OT T (v, x).

The stylesheet view is generated by first copying queries from the TVQ to the OTT (lines 29-31), and then removing pseudo-root nodes, pushing down queries (lines 32-42).</p><p>We now describe the pushing down of queries in more detail. If the child of the pseudo-root is an element specified in the OTT, the query will be empty and unbinding is not required. If the child already has a query (due to an &lt;apply-templates&gt; tag appearing at the top level of a rule body) then the child's tag query needs to be unbound with the tag query of the pseudo-root, a process we call forced unbinding. Note that (1) this significantly limits output formatting, but we believe better formatting can be added without affecting the rest of the algorithm and (2) pushing the query down separately into the apply-templates nodes will cause the results for these apply-templates to be grouped rather than interleaved; leaning more towards the assumption that document order is not supported by view composition.</p><p>For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>, each template rule has some output that will become part of the result tree fragment. However, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 15,  ((1, metro)</ref>, R2) has no output, but one child ((4, confstat), R3). Therefore ott <ref type="figure">((1, metro)</ref>, R2) has only two nodes pseudo-root and apply-templates, and only pseudo-root is kept after all output tag trees are connected into OT T (v, x). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Complexity of the Algorithm</head><p>Below we first show that the time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial when there is at most one incoming edge for each node in context transition graph, and the worst-case time complexity is O(v v ) when this assumption does not hold.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>, the process of generating nodes of CTG (lines 4-7) is bounded by |v|×|x|, where |v| is the number of nodes in schema-tree query v and |x| is the number of rules in stylesheet x. Since there are no conflicting rules in XSLT basic , the number of nodes in CTG is bounded by |v| instead of |v| × |x|. Therefore the process of generating edges of CTG (lines 8-14) is bounded by |v| 2 × maxa, where maxa is the maximum number of applytemplates nodes in a rule in x. The number of edges is also bounded by |v| 2 × maxa. Each edge is annotated with a select-match subtree, with different tag queries. The process of generating TVQ (lines 16-22) involves translating each of such select-match subtrees to a SQL query by unbinding. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>, such unbinding is bound by the number of nodes in a select-match subtree, say max b . The rest of the steps for generating output tag tree and stylesheet view are bounded by the number of nodes and edges of CTG (and also TVQ). Therefore the worst-case running time of the algorithm is bounded <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">by O(min(|v||x|, |v| 3 maxamax b )</ref>). In most cases, |v| would be larger than |x|, therefore the running time is O(|v| 3 maxamax b ).</p><p>However, the nodes with multiple incoming edges should be duplicated in the TVQ (line 17). For a node (n, r) in CTG, its number of incoming edges is at most |v| × maxa. Such a node needs to be duplicated once for every incoming edge and becomes a child of every parent in the TVQ. If some of its parents (n 񮽙 , r 񮽙 ) also have multiple incoming edges, (n, r) needs to be duplicated again together with (n 񮽙 , r 񮽙 ). This process of duplication will go up until reaching the root of TVQ. Therefore (n, r) could at most be duplicated (|v| × maxa) |v|−1 times. After the duplications are completed, the TVQ is a tree. The total number of nodes is at most |v| × (|v| × maxa) |v|−1 . Of course, this complexity would only be realized in extreme cases and we expect in practice that rules will be interrelated on a small scale if at all.</p></div>

The new COMBINE function is almost identical to the previous function, except that when two nodes n1 and n2 with predicates p1 and p2 are unified to form node u, u is given predicate <ref type="bibr">[p1andp2]</ref>. Because of the existence of predicates, in addition to the procedure described in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>, the unbinding of queries must also check if predicates are satisfied for all nodes in the select-match subtree. The changes to the unbinding function and NEST are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 19</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Conflict Resolution for Template Rules</head><p>Each template rule in a XSLT stylesheet has its priority, which varies by position in the stylesheet, and also by the order of in- cluded and imported stylesheets. When multiple rules match a node, XSLT needs a conflict-resolution scheme to select the one rule with the highest priority to apply. The conflict-resolution scheme itself brings no difficulty because the priorities of template rules are statically determined at view-composition time <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The conflictresolution facility in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> could be used for this purpose. The problem arises from the fact that it is impossible to determine at viewcomposition time whether a template rule will match a node. This is because the match pattern in a template has not only name tests but also predicates, the values of which are determinable only during XSLT evaluation at runtime.</p><p>The following approach can be used to compose conflict resolution into SQL queries in XML view. Suppose there is a set of template rules that have the same node name in their last location step (which means they potentially could be conflicting rules). First arrange them as a list of rules in the order of priority. Then in each rule add &lt;xsl:when&gt; elements to test whether the node can be matched by some higher priority rule. The transformation is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 24</ref>. Note that the original n rules have the same mode "m", otherwise they cannot conflict with each other. As seen in the figure, each new &lt;xsl:when&gt; element checks for an "expression i" which is the reverse of the "pattern i" in the i-th template rule. For example, if the pattern i after exten-</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">sion is name1[p1]/name2[p2]/.../namen[pn], then expression i is .[pn]/.../parent::name2[p2]/parent::name1[p1].</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">XSLTrecursion</head><p>Recursion between rules (or with a single rule) can easily arise if the parent or ancestor axes are allowed. In this section, we illustrate an approach to dealing with this recursion. In particular, our goal is to speed up the overall processing time by pushing computation from the stylesheet to the query processor, while leaving the recursion to be handled by the XSLT processor with a modified stylesheet.</p><p>For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 25</ref> is a stylesheet x with recursive rules (R1 and R2).

Its approach generates a single SQL query for an entire XSLT program and tags the SQL result tuples to generate XML output. The technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> begins by separating the XSLT stylesheet into distinct paths. Each path is represented by a structure called QTree. One SQL query is generated for each path by composing its QTree with the XML view tree. The final SQL query for the XSLT stylesheet is a union of all such queries. Our approach improves upon theirs on a number of points. The first point is that we generate a treestructured view query directly rather than an SQL query. Since recent work either (1) optimizes the translation from view-query to SQL-query <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or (2) exploits knowledge of the tree structure during optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we expect this distinction will be more important over time.</p><p>Second, our construction of select-and-match subtrees avoids several issues that arise with the QTree: (1) it is not clear how data values for internal nodes are generated since outer joins are not done along QTree paths, and if outer joins were performed, duplicates would then need to be eliminated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> assumes that only the leaf node of a path contribute to the result. However, in reality all other nodes along the path could generate part of the result. Therefore for each path, one SQL query cannot be sufficient. Instead maximally n (the number of nodes in the path) SQL queries may be necessary. Therefore the final SQL query should be the union of all SQL queries for each QTree, each of which is an outer union of SQL queries for each node on the path represented by the QTree.</p><p>(2) QTree combines the select expressions of different rules as long as they are on the same path. Again because that not only the leaf node but also all nodes on a path could generate result fragment, the predicates in expressions of different rules should not be simply combined together. (3) QTree does not appear to handle the parent axis of XPath, for example, "../hotel available/../confroom" cannot be handled by QTree because the existence of hotel available node is not tested. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> does not cover many features of XSLT. The predicates handled in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> are accesses of attributes or text subelements. It does not consider how to handle the case when they are also ex-&lt;xsl:template match="/metro"&gt; (R1') &lt;xsl:param name="idx" select="10"/&gt; &lt;result_metro&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="metroavail_down[@count&lt;$idx]"&gt; &lt;xsl:with-param name="idx" select="$idx-1"/&gt; &lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt; &lt;/result_metro&gt; &lt;/xsl:template&gt; &lt;xsl:template match="metroavail_down"&gt; (R2') &lt;xsl:param name="idx"/&gt; &lt;xsl:choose&gt; &lt;xsl:when test="$idx&lt;=1"&gt; &lt;xsl:value-of select="."/&gt; &lt;/xsl:when&gt; &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt; &lt;result_metroavail&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="../metroavail_up"&gt; &lt;xsl:with-param name="idx" select="$idx-1"/&gt; &lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt; &lt;result_metroavail&gt; &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt; &lt;/xsl:choose&gt; &lt;/xsl:template&gt; &lt;xsl:template match="metroavail_up"&gt; (R3') &lt;xsl:param name="idx"/&gt; &lt;xsl:choose&gt; &lt;xsl:when test="$idx&lt;=1"&gt; &lt;xsl:value-of select="."/&gt; &lt;/xsl:when&gt; &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt; &lt;result_metroavail&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="../metroavail_down[@count&lt;$idx]"&gt; &lt;xsl:with-param name="idx" select="$idx-1"/&gt; &lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt; &lt;result_metroavail&gt; &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt; &lt;/xsl:choose&gt; &lt;/xsl:template&gt; </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we focus on the problem of evaluating XSL transformations on XML-publishing views. For a subset of XSLT, we present a view-composition algorithm to compose a transformation with an XML view. We then describe how to extend this algorithm to handle most features of XSLT, including certain cases of recursion. Evaluating the composed stylesheet view on a database instance results in the same XML document as evaluating the XSLT stylesheet on the original XML view. In this way, inefficient XSLT processing is replaced by queries pushed into relational database engines. In addition, the stylesheet view does not generate the unnecessary nodes. These features of our approach offer the promise of greatly improved efficiency.</p><p>Based on the view-composition algorithm proposed in this paper, we plan to focus our future work on (1) handling more features of XSLT that were excluded in this paper and (2) developing further the approach of handling recursion and other complicated features by partially pushing functionality from the stylesheet into the query. Finally, we expect that this last approach may be used to ensure that the composition will always run in polynomial time, at the cost of leaving more functionality to be processed by XSLT, and we plan to investigate this tradeoff.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: Skeleton of XSLT template rule. &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt; (R1) &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="metro"/&gt; &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; &lt;/xsl:template&gt; &lt;xsl:template match="metro"&gt; (R2) &lt;result_metro&gt; &lt;A&gt;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="hotel/confstat"/&gt; &lt;/result_metro&gt; &lt;/xsl:template&gt; &lt;xsl:template match="confstat"&gt; (R3) &lt;result_confstat&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="../hotel_available/../confroom"/&gt; &lt;/result_confstat&gt; &lt;/xsl:template&gt; &lt;xsl:template match="metro/hotel/confroom"&gt; (R4) &lt;xsl:value-of select="."/&gt; &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</figDesc></figure>
