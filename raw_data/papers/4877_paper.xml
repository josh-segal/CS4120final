				<p>The recent explosion in the adoption of search engines and new media such as blogs and Twitter have facilitated faster propagation of news and rumors. How quickly does a piece of news spread over these media? How does its popularity diminish over time? Does the rising and falling pattern follow a simple universal law? In this paper, we propose SpikeM, a concise yet flexible analytical model for the rise and fall patterns of influence propagation. Our model has the following advantages: (a) unification power: it generalizes and explains earlier theoretical models and empirical observations; (b) practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data; (c) parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters; and (d) usefulness: it enables further analytics tasks such as forecasting , spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse-engineering the system parameters of interest (e.g. quality of news, count of interested bloggers, etc.). Using SpikeM, we analyzed 7.2GB of real data, most of which were collected from the public domain. We have shown that our SpikeM model accurately and succinctly describes all the patterns of the rise-and-fall spikes in these real datasets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>How do spikes behave in social media? Online social media is spreading news and rumors in new ways and search engines have facilitated such spreading magnificently, creating bursts and spikes. Some rumors (or memes, hashtags) start Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Data sequences span over 120 time-ticks, while SpikeM requires only seven parameters. The fit is so good, that the red line is often invisible, due to occlusion.</p><p>slowly and linger; others spike early and then decay; others show more complicated behavior, as we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Do real rise-and-fall patterns have any qualitative differences? Do they form different classes? If yes, how many? Earlier work on Youtube data claims there are four classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Empirical work found six classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. How many classes are there after all?</p><p>Our answer is: one. We provide a unifying model, SpikeM, that requires only a handful of parameters, and we show that it can generate all patterns found in real data simply by changing the parameter values. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows six representative spikes of online media (memes) from K-SC <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, as gray circles, as well as our fitted model, as a solid red line. Notice that the fitting is very  good, despite the fact that our SpikeM model requires only seven parameters, and that the time-sequences span 120 intervals.</p><p>Informally, the problem we want to solve is to model/predict an activity (e.g., number of blog postings), as a function of time, given some breaking-news at a given timetick. We will use a blogger example for brevity and clarity, but many other processes could be also modeled (people buying products, computer viruses infecting machines, rumors spreading over Twitter, etc). Thus, we have:</p><p>Informal Problem 1 (what-if). Given a network of bloggers (/hosts/buyers), a shock (e.g., event) at time n b , the interest/quality of the event, the count S b of bloggers that immediately (= time n b ) blog about the event, find how the blogging activity will evolve over time.</p><p>A closely related problem is to develop a parsimonious model, that can be made to fit several spikes observed in the past (as we do in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). That is,</p><p>Informal Problem 2 (model design). Given the behavior of several spikes in the past, find an equation/model that can explain them, with as few parameters as possible.</p><p>It would be good if the parameters had an intuitive explanation (like, 'number of bloggers', 'quality of news', etc, as opposed to, say, a1, a2 of an autoregressive model (AR/ARIMA)).</p><p>In this paper, we propose SpikeM model to solve both of the aforementioned problems. Our SpikeM has the following advantages:</p><p>• Unification power: it includes earlier patterns and models as special cases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>), • Practicality: it matches the behavior of numerous, diverse, real datasets, including power-law decay • Parsimony: our model requires only a handful of parameters • Usefulness: thanks to the SpikeM model, we can answer 'what-if' questions (see subsection 5.1), spot outliers, reverse-engineer the system parameters (quality of news, count of interested bloggers, time-of-day behavior of bloggers)</p><p>Our SpikeM model is enabled by a careful design to incorporate (a) the power-law decay in infectivity, (b) a finite population, and (c) proper periodicities. Earlier models ignored one or more of the above issues.</p><p>Thanks to the practicality of SpikeM, we can make forecasting, analysis of 'what-if' scenarios, and detection of anomalies, as we show in section 4 and section 5. We should highlight that traditional AR, ARIMA and related linear models are fundamentally unsuitable, because they are linear (and can diverge to infinity) and because they lead to exponential decays (as opposed to the power law that reality seems to obey). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> illustrates the relative advantages of our method: the C-S method (Crane and Sornette) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> assumes an infinite population of bloggers; the clusters in K-SC <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> (repeated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) are non-parametric and are incapable of forecasting. The SI model (closely related to the Bass model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> of the market penetration of new products) leads to exponential decay, as opposed to the power-law decay that we observe in real data. Outline. The rest of the paper goes as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of the related work and Section 3 the proposed model. Sections 4 and 5 show our experimental results on a variety of datasets. We conclude in section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND</head><p>In this section, we present the fundamental concepts. Epidemiology fundamentals.</p><p>The most basic epidemic model is the so-called 'Susceptible-Infected' (SI) model. Each object/node is in one of two states -Susceptible (S) or Infected (I). Each infected node attempts to infect each of its neighbors independently with probability β, which reflects the strength of the virus. Once infected, each node stays infected forever. If we assume that the underlying network is a clique of N nodes, and use our notation ('B' for blogged = infected) the most basic form of the model is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dB(t) dt = β * (N − B(t))B(t)<label>( 1 )</label></formula><p>where the time t is considered continuous, dB/dt is the derivative, and the initial condition reflects the external shock (say, B(0) = b externally infected people). The justification is as follows: β is the strength of the virus, that is, the probability that an encounter between an infected person ('B') and an uninfected one, will end up in an infection -and we have B * (N − B) such encounters. The solution for B() is the sigmoid, and its derivative is symmetric around the peak, with an exponential rise and an exponential fall (we discuss later in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). There we also show the weakness of the SI model: real data have a power-law 'fall' pattern. Self-excited Hawkes process. Crane et al.</p><p>[6] used a self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson process <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to model YouTube views per day, showing that spikes in the activity have a power-law rise pattern, and a power-law fall pattern, depending on the model parameters. Roughly, the Hawkes process is a Poisson process where the instantaneous rate is not constant, but depends on the count of previous events, whose effect drops with the age τ of the event. That is, if there were a lot of events (viewings/bloggings) recently, we will have many such events today.</p><p>The base model states that the rate of spread of infection depends on (a) the external source S(t) and (b) selfexcitation, that is, on earlier-infected nodes (i = 1, . . .); these nodes spread the infection with decaying virus strength φ(τ ), their age τ grows, times some constant µi. The constant µi is equivalent to the degree of the infected node i.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">dB(t) dt = S(t) + 񮽙 i,t i ≤t µiφ(t − ti)<label>( 2 )</label></formula><p>The model typically assumes that the µi values are equal, namely that all nodes have the same degree ('homogeneous' graph). It also silently assumes that there are infinite nodes available for infection, and it may actually diverge to infinity. Next we present our SpikeM model, which avoids the shortcomings of the SI and Hawkes models, and has several more desirable properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PROPOSED METHOD</head><p>In this section we present our proposed method, analyze it, and we provide the reader with several interesting -at least in our opinion-observations.</p><p>Our model tries to capture the following behaviors, that we observed with several of our real data</p><p>• P1: power-law fall pattern • P2: periodicities and at the same time we want to</p><p>• P3: avoid the divergence to infinity that other models may have. To handle P3 (divergence), we force our model to have a finite population, and adjust the equations accordingly. To handle P1 (power-law fall pattern), we assume that the infectivity of a node (= popularity of a blog post) decays with the influence exponent, which we set at -1.5. The handling of periodicities is discussed in subsection 3.2.</p><p>We describe our model in steps, adding complexity, and we start with the base model. Preliminaries. We assume there are N bloggers, and none of them is yet blogging about the topic of interest. At time n b , an event happens (such as the 2004 Indonesian tsunami, or a controversial political speech such as 'lipstick on a pig'), and S b bloggers immediately blog about it. We refer to this external event as a shock, and n b and S b are the birth-time and the initial magnitude of the shock.</p><p>Our model needs a few more parameters: the first is the quality/interestingness of the news, which we refer to as β, since this is the standard symbol for the infectivity of a virus in epidemiology literature. If β is zero, nobody cares about this specific piece of news; the higher the value, the more bloggers will blog about it.</p><p>Finally, we have the decay function f (n), which models how infective/influential a blog posting is, at age n. Standard epidemiology models assume that f () is constant (once sick, you have the same probability of infecting others); recent analysis has shown that the influence drops with age, following a power law.</p><p>The above are the parameters of the base model. Before we list the equations, we want to briefly mention a derived quantity, β * N ; this quantity roughly corresponds to the R0 ('R-naught') found in the epidemiology literature. This tells us the size of the "first burst": if only one person was infected, how many would be infected in the next time-tick? <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> In summary, the scenario we model is as follows:</p><p>• nothing happens, until a news-event appears, at birthtime n b .</p><p>• S b bloggers immediately blog about it.</p><p>• other bloggers visit the initial S b (or follow-up) bloggers, and occasionally get 'infected' and blog about the event, too.</p><p>We also assume that</p><p>• each blogger blogs at most once about the event • no other related event occurs -that is, the shock function S() has only one spike.</p><p>Without loss of generality, we also assume that once an uninformed blogger sees an infected/informed blog, he/she always blogs about the event (if he/she blogs with probability ρ &lt; 1, we could absorb ρ in the infectivity factor β) Our goal is to find an equation to describe the number ∆B(n) of people blogging at time-tick n, as a function of n and of course the system parameters (total number of bloggers N , strength of infection β etc).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Base model -SpikeM-Base</head><p>The model we propose has nodes (=bloggers) of two states:</p><p>• U: Un-informed of the rumor • B: informed, and Blogged about it For those who just got informed at time-tick n, we'll use the symbol ∆B(n), and we assume that, once informed, a person will blog about the rumor immediately.</p><p>Let U (n) be the number of un-informed people at time n, and let ∆B(n) the number of people that just found out about the rumor at time n, and blogged immediately about it.</p><p>Model 1 (SpikeM-Base). Our base model is governed by the equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∆B(n + 1) = U (n) · n 񮽙 t=n b 񮽙 ∆B(t) + S(t) 񮽙 · f (n + 1 − t) + 񮽙 (3) U (n + 1) = U (n) − ∆B(n + 1) (4)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f (τ ) = β * τ −1.5<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and initial conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∆B(0) = 0, U(0) = N</formula><p>In addition, we add an external shock S(n), a spike generated at birth-time n b . Mathematically, it is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S(n) = 񮽙 0 (n 񮽙 = n b ) S b (n = n b ) (6)</formula><p>Justification of the model. We do it in steps:</p><p>• The term ∆B(t) + S(t) captures the count of bloggers plus external sources, that got activated at time-tick t; their infectivity is modulated by the f () infectivity function, since we assume that the infectivity of a source/blogger decays with time. The summation is over all past time-ticks since the birth-time n b of the shock.</p><p>• The infectivity function f () exactly follows a power law with exponent -1.5 as discovered by earlier work on read data: real bloggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and response to mails by Einstein and Darwin <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>• The meaning of the summation is the available stimuli at time-tick n; the available targets are the uninformed bloggers U (n), and the product gives the number of new infections.</p><p>• We add a noise term 񮽙 to handle cases such as hashtag 'egypt' on Twitter: some people tweet about Egypt anyway, but a large shock occurred during the events in Tahrir square. Very often, 񮽙 񮽙 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symbol Definition</head><formula xml:id="formula_6">N total population of available bloggers n d duration of sequence n time-tick (n = 0, . . . , n d ) U (n) count of un-informed bloggers B(n)</formula><p>count of informed bloggers ∆B(n) delta: count of informed bloggers at exactly time n f (n) infectiveness of a blog-post, at age n β strength of infection β * N "first-burst" size of infection S(n) volume of external shock at time n n b starting time of breaking news S b strength of external shock at birth (time n b ) 񮽙 background noise Pa strength of periodicity Pp period Ps phase shift of periodicity This completes the justification of our base model. We also mention some facts that our model obeys: by definition</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">B(n) = n 񮽙 t=0 ∆B(t)</formula><p>and of course we have the invariant</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">B(n) + U (n) = N</formula><p>where N is the total number of people/bloggers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">With periodicity -SpikeM</head><p>Bloggers may modulate their activity following a daily cycle (or weekly, or yearly). For example, among the U (n) uninformed bloggers at time n, a fraction of them are not paying attention (say, because they are tired or asleep). How can we reflect this in our equations? We propose an answer below, and then we provide the justification.</p><p>Model 2 (SpikeM). We can capture the periodic behavior of bloggers with the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆B(n + 1) = p(n + 1)· 񮽙 U (n) · n 񮽙 t=n b 񮽙 ∆B(t) + S(t) 񮽙 · f (n + 1 − t) + 񮽙 񮽙 (7) p(n) = 1 − 1 2 Pa 񮽙 sin 񮽙 2π Pp (n + Ps) 񮽙 + 1 񮽙 (8)</formula><p>where U (n), S(t) and f (n) are defined in Model 1.</p><p>Justification. The model is identical to SpikeM-base, with the addition of the periodicity factor p(·). This captures the fact that bloggers tone down their activity, say, during the night, or even stop it altogether. The idea is that U (·) is the count of victims available for infection, and the summation is the number of attacks. Under normal circumstances, each victim-attack pair would lead to a new victim; however, since the victims are not paying full attention (tired/asleep), the attacks are not so successful, and thus we prorate them by the p() periodic function. • Pp stands for the period of the cycle (say, 24 hours).</p><p>• Ps stands for the phase shift: if the peak activity is at noon, and the period is Pp=24 hours, then Ps=18.</p><p>• Pa depends on the amplitude of the fluctuation, and specifically it gives the relative value of the off-time (say, midnight), versus peak time (say, noon). Thus, if Pa=0, we have no fluctuation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Additional details</head><p>Model extensions. We could easily extend our model so that it has several shocks as opposed to just one as considered here. We could also extend it to have multiple cycles (daily, weekly, yearly). We do not elaborate on these extensions for two reasons: (a) for clarity and (b) because the current model fits real data very well, anyway. Learning the parameters. Our model consists of a set of seven parameters: θ = {N, β, n b , S b , , Pa, Ps}. Given a real time sequence X(n) of bloggers at time-tick n (n = 1, . . . , n d ), we use Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to minimize the sum of the errors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">D(X, θ) = 񮽙 n d n=1 (X(n) − ∆B(n)) 2 .</formula><p>Analysis -exponential rise, power-law fall. It is not obvious from the equations of our model, but its rise pattern is exponential, while the fall pattern obeys a power law. This is desirable, because this behavior seem to be prevailing in real data, as we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. Let n mode denote the time-tick at which the wave ∆B() reached its maximum volume. By rise plot we mean the plot of values from the birth-time n b until n mode (and reversing time abs(n − n mode )) The fall-plot is defined similarly: activity ∆B() versus delay from the peak n − n mode . Notice that there is a power law for the fall, and an exponential shape for the rise. We also show the traditional 'SI' model, which, as expected, exhibits exponential behavior for both rise and fall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of SpikeM, we carried out experiments on real datasets. The experiments were designed to answer the following questions:</p><p>• Q1: Can we explain the cluster centers of K-SC?</p><p>• Q2: How well do we match MemeTracker data?</p><p>• Q3: How does it compare with other data?</p><p>• Q4: How well do we forecast future patterns?</p><p>Dataset description. We performed experiments on the following three real datasets.</p><p>• MemeTracker: This dataset covers three months of blog activity from August 1 to October 31 2008 2 , It contains short quoted textual phrases ("memes"), each of which consists of the number of mentions over time.</p><p>We choose 1,000 phrases in blogs with the highest volume in a 7-day window around their peak volume.</p><p>• Twitter: We used more than 7 million Twitter 3 posts covering an 8-month period from June 2011 to January 2012. We selected the 10,000 most frequently used hashtags.</p><p>• GoogleTrends: This dataset consists of the volume of searches for various queries (i.e., words) on Google 4 . Each query represents the search volumes that are related to keywords over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Q1: Explaining K-SC clusters</head><p>The results on this dataset were already presented in section 1 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Our model correctly captures the six patterns of K-SC. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> gives a further description of the SpikeM fitting. Our model consists of seven parameters, each of which describes the behavior of spikes. Note that the total populations N are almost the same for all patterns, (around 2,000 to 3,000). This is because these six patterns are scaled on the y-axis so that they all have a peak volume of 100. We can see that β * N is between 0.7 − 1.0 for these six patterns. We also see that Pattern C3 has an extreme shock S b = 114 at time n b = 40, which means that this spike is strongly affected by the external burst of activity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1 (c)</ref>). On the other hand, Patterns C4-C6 have several peaks about 24 hours apart with a strength Pa 񮽙 0.4.</p><p>We also evaluated our fitting accuracy by using the root mean square error (RM SE) between estimated values and real values: <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows the fitting accuracy result for six patterns of K-SC. We compared SpikeM with SI model. As discussed in section 3 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>), SI cannot model the tail parts of the spikes. On the other hand, our solution, SpikeM achieves high accuracy for every pattern of K-SC.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: The model parameters of our SpikeM best fitting on six patterns of K-SC (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> shows the results of model fitting on the MemeTracker dataset. We selected six typical sequences according to the K-SC clusters. That is, each sequence corresponds to each pattern (C1-C6). We show the original sequences (black dots) and SpikeM fitting, ∆B(n) (red line) in both linear-linear (top) and log-log (bottom) scales. In the loglog scale, we also show the count of un-informed bloggers, U (n). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>, the bottom table shows the short phrases (memes) of each sequence. All of the phrases are sourced from U.S. politics in 2008. We obtained several observations for each sequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">RM SE = 񮽙 1 n d 񮽙 n d n (X(n) − ∆B(n)) 2 .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pattern</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Q2: Matching MemeTracker patterns</head><p>• Patterns C1 and C2: almost the same size of population, N 񮽙 500, except that C2 has a quicker rise and fall (i.e., stronger infection, β * N = 1.4) than C1 (β * N = 0.94).</p><p>• Pattern C3: this sequence has a sudden rise and a power law decay. There is a slight daily periodicity.</p><p>• Patterns C4 and C5: there are clearly daily periodicities. Pattern C6, "lipstick on a pig" has the largest population of all six sequences (i.e., N = 6259).</p><p>• Pattern C6: the sequence: "yes we can" consists of huge spikes around n = 40, and constant periodic noise. This is because the bloggers mention this phrase as Barack Obama's slogan as well as with more general meanings. We can also find that there are several extreme points (i.e., missing values) around n = 120 (see blue circle in log-log scale).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Q3: Matching other data</head><p>We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for other types of spikes.</p><p>Fitting on Twitter data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> describes our fitting results on the hashtags of Twitter data. In this figure, we can see that Twitter data behave similarly to MemeTracker data. Due to space limitations, we show only three major hashtags. Note that the top and bottom rows are in linear-linear and log-log scales, respectively. Our model captures the following characteristics: (a) #assange: this is a topic about Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. There are several mentions before the peak point (December 5, 2011).

This was caused by the death of Steve Jobs. (c) #ar-resteddevelopment: this a topic about the movie "Arrested Development".

We can also observe influence propagation in queries on internet search engines. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref> shows two different types of spikes on GoogleTrends. For an external catastrophic event (a) "tsunami", we see that there is a super quick rise immediately after the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2005. In contrast, (b) "harry potter" has a slower rise, which is because this spike was generated by "word-of-mouth" activity surrounding the release of a Harry Potter movie in 2007. SpikeM evidently captures both types of spikes successfully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Q4: Tail-part forecasts</head><p>So far we have seen how SpikeM captures the pattern dynamics for various spikes. Here, we answer a more practical question: given the first part of the spike, how can we forecast the future behavior of the tail part? <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6</ref> shows results of our forecasts on MemeTracker data. We selected two the highest population phrases (#9 and #13 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig- ure 3)</ref>. We trained our models by using the values obtained over a period of 54 hours (solid black lines in the <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>, and then forecasted the following days (solid red lines, about five days). Note that the vertical axis uses a logarithmic scale. We compared SpikeM with the auto regressive model (AR). For a fair comparison, we used seven regression coefficients, which was the same size as our model parameters.</p><p>Our method achieves high forecasting accuracy while AR failed to forecast future patterns. More specifically, the reconstruction errors of SpikeM are RM SE = 9.26 and 8.93 for #9 and #13, while AR has errors of 13.98 and 14.19. Similar trends are observed in other phrases, however we omit the results due to space limitations. More importantly, our model can forecast the rise part of spikes as well as the tail part (discussed in Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION -SpikeM AT WORK</head><p>Our proposed model, SpikeM is capable of various applications. Here, we describe important applications and show some usefulness examples of our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">"What-if" forecasting</head><p>We have discussed tail-part forecasting in subsection 4.4. Ideally, we want to forecast not only the tail-part, but also the rise-part of a spike. This is much more difficult, because we usually have very few points in the rise-part of a spike. : Results of tail-part forecasting on MemeTracker data. We train spikes from n = 0 to 54, and then, start forecasting at time n = 54. Our SpikeM reflects reality better, while AR quickly converges to the zero.</p><p>However, if this is a repeating event, like, say, the spikes induced by 'Harry Potter' movies releases, can we forecast future spikes if we know the release date of the next movie? It turns out that our SpikeM model can help with this (difficult) task, too. Thus, the problem we address in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7</ref> is as follows: we are given (a) the first spike in 2009, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" (n = 185); (b) the release dates of the two sequel movies (blue text with as arrows pointed at n = 255 and 289), and (c) the access volume before the release dates (and specifically from 8 to 2 weeks before). Can we forecast the rise and fall shapes of upcoming spikes and their peak points?</p><p>Solution and results. SpikeM can predict the potential population N of users who are interested in "Harry Potter", and the strength of 'word-of-mouth' infection: β. Our solution is to assume that these values are fixed for all of the sequel spikes. The only difference is the strength of the "external shock", i.e., n b and S b . Our solution consists of the following three-step process:</p><p>1. Train the parameter set θ by using the first spike (solid black line in the figure). 2. With the fixed parameters θ, infer the new values ofñ of˜ofñ b and˜Sand˜ and˜S b by using the beginning part of the next spike (blue lines between double arrows at n = 250 and 280). 3. Generate the spikes using θ andñand˜andñ b and˜Sand˜ and˜S b (red lines).</p><p>In conclusion, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7</ref> shows that our model successfully captures the two sequel spikes and peak points n mode .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Outlier detection</head><p>Since SpikeM has a very high fitting accuracy on real datasets (described in section 4), another natural application would be anomaly detection. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the fitting result of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref> (a), in a log-log scale. Note that the black circles are the original sequence, and the pink line is our model fitting. We can visually observe that there are several points that do not overlap the model. For example, (a) on March 29, there is one spike, since another earthquake occurred on March 28. (b) There is a huge spike on December <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">2005</ref>, which is exactly one year after the Indian Ocean earthquake.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observation 1 (Total population of bloggers).</head><p>The total populations of potential bloggers/users N are almost same for both datasets (around N = 1, 000 − 2, 000).</p><p>We also note that they are skewed to the right, i.e., there is a long tail of larger values.</p><p>Observation 2 (Strength of first infection). The strength of the "first burst" is β * N 񮽙 1.0 for each dataset.</p><p>The above two observations agree with the intuition: we can see common behavior for MemeTracker and Twitter, which means that they have similar characteristics in terms of social activities.</p><p>Observation 3 (Common activity and periodicity). Typical user behavior is to have a daily periodicity with (a) phase shift Ps = 0 (small population during early morning, large population at peak point, 6pm) for MemeTracker, while (b) more spread in Ps.</p><p>Note that more than 90% of all spikes have a daily periodicity in both datasets. The only the difference between the two datasets is that Twitter has several Ps values. This is because Twitter has multiple time zones (e.g., US, UK, Australia, and India).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">RELATED WORK</head><p>We present the related work, in three areas: time series analysis, influence propagation, and burst detection.</p><p>Time series Analysis.
