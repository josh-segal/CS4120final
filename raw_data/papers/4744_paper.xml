				<p>Given a database instance and a corresponding view instance , we address the view definitions problem (VDP): Find the most succinct and accurate view definition, when the view query is restricted to a specific family of queries. We study the tradeoffs among succintness, level of approximation , and the family of queries through algorithms and complexity results. For each family of queries, we address three variants of the VDP: (1) Does there exist an exact view definition , and if so find it. (2) Find the best view definition, i.e., one as close to the input view instance as possible, and as succinct as possible. (3) Find an approximate view definition that satisfies an input approximation threshold, and is as succinct as possible.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>Our work can be differentiated from related work in two ways: the scope of the problem addressed, and the evaluation metrics.</p><p>Related to scope, we address a narrower problem than others but with more depth. For example, decision trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> are used to classify items. Our VDP can be viewed as a classification problem with only two classes: tuples in V and those not in V . Thus, VDP is narrower since only two classes are considered. However, we go deeper into this subproblem by considering multiple query families and multiple optimization criteria. Similarly, Query By Output (QBO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is a more general problem than ours. In QBO, we are given V and R1, R2, . . . , Rn, and asked to return Q such that Q(R1, R2, . . . , Rn) = V . Thus, VDP is the special case where n = 1 and there are no joins nor projections. However, as mentioned above, we thoroughly study the VDP subproblem by considering different classes of selection queries and multiple optimization criteria.</p><p>The second differentiator for our work is the metrics we use: succinctness and level of approximation. Most classification work, on the other hand, relies on experimental generality, mentioned earlier. When generality is a goal, we are given, in addition to D and V (the training sets), two test data sets, DT and VT . Query Q is determined without seeing the test sets, only using the training sets. However, Q is evaluated by the level of approximation of Q(DT ) to VT . Generality is an experimental measure, although one can study generality by assuming that <ref type="bibr">D and DT (and V and VT )</ref> have "similar" statistical properties. On the other hand, our notion of succinctness is an intrinsic property of a query. Intuitively, a succinct query will be more general than a less succinct query that overfits the data. In addition, succinctness is also desirable because it yields more readable (and more maintainable) queries. When succinctness is a goal (as it is in this paper), we can obtain theoretical guarantees, e.g., an algorithm can find the most succinct Q within a family of queries in quadratic time.</p><p>Next we present some additional details about decision trees and QBO.</p><p>Classification: Decision trees are used to classify items into n ≥ 2 classes. A decision tree is simply a binary tree with each tree node annotated with a predicate. One child of the node corresponds to the predicate evaluating to true, and the other child corresponds to the predicate evaluating to false. Each leaf node is labeled with a class label from C1, . . . , Cn. For VDP, we restrict n = 2 (tuple present in the view, or not present in the view).</p><p>Thus a decision tree for n = 2 corresponds to a query of the following form: Q = (p1 ∧ Q ) ∨ (¬p1 ∧ Q ), where p1 is the splitting predicate, and Q and Q are recursively of the same form. However, note that some queries may not be directly expressible using decision trees. For example, the query (((A = 3) ∧ (B = 4)) ∨ (B = 5)), which may be the query with the smallest number of predicates cannot be directly expressed as a decision tree (since each node in a decision tree divides/splits the items into two mutually exclusive sets).</p><p>In our work we not only consider more general queries, but we also provide a taxonomy of different query families, showing how complexity of VDP relates to the query family. In addition, as mentioned earlier, we do not use experimental generality, but focus on metrics that do not need test data.</p><p>Query by Output: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, QBO is cast as a classification problem (into two classes: tuples in V , and tuples not in V ) and decision trees are used to find a compact query. A decision tree is constructed in a greedy fashion by determining a "good" predicate to split the tuples into two classes. These two classes form the root nodes of two decision trees (each of which is constructed in a recursive fashion). The "goodness" of a predicate is assessed using a metric called Gini's index <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and the best predicate is the one that reduces the Gini's index the most. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> does not explicitly try to optimize our metrics of succinctness or level or approximation, nor does it study the tradeoff between these metrics. Also, it does not consider the different families of queries that we do.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PROBLEM DEFINITIONS</head><p>In this paper, we assume that database D is a single relation R. We additionally assume that the relation R and the view V have the same schema. For V to be a meaningful view of R, it is necessary that V ⊆ R. We assume set semantics throughout the paper.</p><p>Since we deal with single table relations with both V and R having the same schema, any query Q can be represented as a selection condition. Any selection condition can be expressed as a DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) formula, i.e., Q ≡ c1 ∨ c2 ∨ . . . ∨ cn. Each ci, called a conjunctive clause, is of the form pi1 ∧ pi2 ∧ . . . pim i , where each pij is a predicate. We restrict our predicates to be equalities (e.g., a = 5), inequalities (e.g., a = 5) or ranges (a ∈ <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>). If Q ≡ c1, i.e., if Q contains a single conjunctive clause, then Q is a conjunctive query (CQ). A DNF selection condition is therefore equivalent to a union of conjunctive queries (UCQ).</p><p>For each family of queries that we consider, we are interested in obtaining Q such that: (1) Q(R) is as close to V as possible (i.e., as accurate as possible): Intuitively, Q(R) should miss out on few tuples from V , and should include few tuples not in V . (2) Q is as succinct as possible. Next we introduce a difference measure to quantify the closeness   between V and Q(R) (Section 2.1) and a metric of succinctness for queries (Section 2.2). Then, we formally define the specific problems addressed in this paper (Section 2.3), and the families of queries we consider (Section 2.4). Finally, in Section 2.5, we present a summary of our results. We use the following running example throughout the paper.</p><p>Example 2.1. Consider a relation Rmov giving information about movies, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Also consider a relation Vmov in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, obtained from Rmov through manual selection of tuples. Henceforth, we use R and V to abbreviate Rmov and Vmov respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Difference Metric</head><p>Given relations R, V , and a query Q, we say that Q(R) is close to V if Q(R) has few incorrect or missing tuples. The difference between two relations of the same schema (in this case Q(R) and V ) is captured by their symmetric set difference:</p><p>Definition 2.2 (Difference). Given two relations R1 and R2, we say that the difference between R1 and R2 is given by d(R1, R2) = |R1 − R2| + |R2 − R1|.</p><p>Note that the definition above can also be interpreted as the total number of tuples that need to be deleted or added to convert relation R1 into relation R2 (or vice versa). The smaller the difference d(Q(R), V ), the closer Q(R) is to V .</p><p>There are situations when we may have an additional constraint that one of either |V − Q(R)| or |Q(R) − V | should be 0, i.e., we require Q(R) to be either a superset or a subset of V . For instance, suppose the result of finding a view definition is given to a human for manual pruning. In such a case it may be critical to capture all result tuples in V , but extra tuples in Q(R) can be removed manually. We consider difference metrics incorporating these additional constraints in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Query Succinctness</head><p>We first introduce the notion of size, for conjunctive queries and unions of conjunctive queries, and then define succinctness in terms of size. We measure the size of a conjunctive query (CQ) as its number of predicates. We measure the size of a union of conjunctive queries (UCQ) as its number of unions. For UCQs, an alternative metric would include both number of unions and number of predicates in each clause. We studied this alternative metric as well for each of the problems we discuss in this paper, and the algorithms and complexity are similar. Additionally, if the average size of each conjunctive clause is similar, the number of unions is a good measure of the complexity of the queries. We mention differences whenever appropriate, but primarily use the metric based on number of unions. Thus we have: Definition 2.3 (Size). The size of a conjunctive query Q, size(Q), is the number of predicates in Q. The size of a union of conjunctive queries Q, size(Q), is the number of unions appearing in Q.</p><p>Given two queries from the same family Q and Q , we say that Q is more succinct than Q if Q has a smaller size.</p><p>Definition 2.4 (Relative-Succinctness). Given two queries Q and Q from a family Q of queries, we say that Q Q , i.e., Q is at least as succinct as Q , if size(Q)≤size(Q ). We say that Q is more succinct than Q if Q Q but not Q Q. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">View Definition Problems</head><p>Next we enumerate the problems we study in the rest of the paper. The first problem considers whether given R and V , there is an exact view definition in a certain query family. Definition 2.6 (Exact View Def. (EVD)). Given relation R, view V , and a query family Q, return a Q ∈ Q such that V = Q(R), if such a Q exists.</p><p>There may be several queries Q such that V = Q(R), as we've seen in Example 2.5. Our next problem addresses the case when EVD doesn't have a unique solution, or when it has no solution at all. When EVD has multiple solutions, we want the most succinct one. When there is no exact view definition at all, as a first priority we want the closest query, and as a second priority we want the most succinct one. Definition 2.7 (Best View Def. (BVD)). Given relation R, view V , and a family of queries Q, find and return any Q ∈ Q such that:</p><p>(1) there is no</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q ∈ Q with d(V, Q (R)) &lt; d(V, Q(R)) (2) ∀ Q ∈ Q with d(V, Q (R)) = d(V, Q(R)), Q Q .</formula><p>In some cases, minimizing the difference may be less critical than obtaining a succinct view definition. For instance, an approximate view definition that gets close to V may suffice, but we would like the most succinct view definition that achieves the required approximation. The next problem finds the most succinct view definition that satisfies a minimum level of approximation specified by a threshold on the difference metric.</p><p>Definition 2.8 (Approximate View Def. (AVD)). Given relation R, view V , approximation threshold τ , and a family of queries Q, check if ∃Q ∈ Q such that:</p><p>(1) d(V, Q(R)) ≤ τ (2) if for any Q ∈ Q, d(V, Q (R)) ≤ τ , then Q Q . and return any such Q if one exists.</p><p>For all three problems, we use the difference metric from Definition 2.2. Also recall from Section 2.1 the alternative difference metrics that require either |V − Q(R)| = 0 or |Q(R) − V | = 0, i.e., seeking view definitions that result in supersets or subsets of V respectively. In Section 6 we consider two variants of BVD: (1) BVD-Sup, equivalent to BVD but restricted to view definitions Q satisfying Q(R) ⊇ V ; (2) BVD-Sub, equivalent to BVD but restricted to view definitions Q satisfying Q(R) ⊆ V . Definition 2.9 (Approximation Ratio). Given relation R, view V , a family of queries Q (and τ in the case of AVD), we say that a solution Q ∈ Q gives an α-approximation to BVD (AVD resp.) if Q satisfies (1) Condition-1 of Definition 2.7 (Definition 2.8 resp.); and (2) Condition-2 of Definition 2.7 (Definition 2.8 resp.) by replacing "Q Q " with "size(Q)≤ α.size(Q )".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Families of Queries</head><p>We consider the following families of queries:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• CQ 1 = :</formula><p>A conjunctive query with a single equality predicate A = a.</p><p>• CQ 1 : A conjunctive query with a single range predicate, i.e., A = a or A = a or A ∈ [a1, a2].</p><p>• CQ = : A conjunctive query with any number of equality predicates, but at most one predicate per attribute.</p><p>• CQ: A conjunctive query with any number of range predicates, but at most one predicate per attribute.</p><p>• UCQ = : Unions of CQ = queries.</p><p>• UCQ: Unions of CQ queries.</p><p>• UCQ k = : Union of at most k CQ = queries (k ≥ 1).</p><p>• UCQ k : Union of at most k CQ queries (k ≥ 1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Results and Outline</head><p>Consider the EVD, BVD, and AVD problems for a relation R with M attributes and N tuples. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> summarizes the results we have obtained for all the problems specified in Section 2.3, showing worst-case complexity and approximation ratios. (Some results from <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> are relatively straightforward, but still included in the paper for completeness.) For UCQ k = and UCQ k , since the size of the query is fixed (to k unions), we use an approximation metric different from Definition 2.9, requiring different techniques and analysis (discussed in Section 5).</p><p>Note that for some of the problems listed here, we analyze data complexity, i.e., the complexity on keeping schema size fixed and varying the size of the data (the number of tuples in R) as well as combined complexity, i.e., the complexity when neither schema size nor data size is fixed. We analyze these two cases separately because the data complexity may be different from the combined complexity for some problems, e.g., BVD for CQ, where the data complexity is PTIME(N ), while the combined complexity is NPComplete (denoted as NP-Complete(N, M )). Similar notions were first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Family EVD BVD AVD BVD-Sup BVD-Sub CQ 1 = O(M N ) O(M N ) O(M N ) O(M N ) O(M N ) CQ 1 O(M N 2 ) O(M N 2 ) O(M N 2 ) O(M N ) O(M N 2 ) CQ = O(M N ) O(M N M +1 ) O(M N M +1 ) O(M N.2 M ) O(M.N M +1 ) NP-Hard(N,M ) NP-complete(N,M ) O(M N 2 ) log N -approx O(M N τ +2 ) log N -approx CQ O(M N ) O(M N 2M +1 ) O(M N 2M +1 ) O(M N.2 M ) O(M.N 2M +1 ) NP-Hard(N,M ) NP-complete(N,M ) NP-Hard(N,M ) NP-Hard(N,M ) O(M N 3 ) log N -approx O(M N τ +3 ) log N -approx U CQ = O(M N ) NP-complete(N,M ) NP-complete(N,M ) N/A N/A P T IM E(N M ) log N -approx.

Also note that the NP-Completeness results for UCQ k = and UCQ k for EVD, BVD and BVD-Sup/Sub only hold if we allow the parameter k and the schema size M to vary along with N , the data size. If not, the problems are solvable in PTIME in N . Further, we don't consider AVD for UCQ k = and U CQ k since the size of all these queries is fixed (k clauses), therefore, the solution to AVD is no different from the solution to BVD. The approximation result for AVD for CQ and CQ = only holds for the special case when the view definition is required to give a superset of V , i.e., the analog of BVD-Sup for AVD.</p><p>In the remainder of the paper, we present details for all the results from <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, organized as follows. Section 3.1 considers the families of queries CQ 1 = and CQ 1 . Section 3.2 considers the families CQ = and CQ. Section 4 considers the families U CQ = and UCQ. Section 5 considers the families UCQ k = and U CQ k . The BVD-Sup and BVD-Sub problems are studied in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">FAMILIES OF CONJUNCTIVE QUERIES</head><p>We first consider the families of conjunctive queries with single predicates, i.e., CQ 1 = and CQ 1 (Section 3.1). We then consider the families CQ = and CQ of conjunctive queries with multiple predicates (Section 3.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Single Predicate</head><p>Since the results for single-predicate queries are simple in comparison to the other families of queries, we only state our main results, in the next two theorems. Details are presented in Appendix A.</p><p>Theorem 3.1.

This computation is significantly aided by hashing, allowing all counts to be obtained in O(M N ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Multiple Predicates</head><p>Next we consider the view definition problems for conjunctive queries, i.e., families CQ and CQ = . First, we present a connection between our problems and a set cover formulation, which is used in the rest of the section (Section 3.2.1). We then study EVD (Section 3.2.2), BVD (Section 3.2.3) and AVD (Section 3.2.4) problems respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Set Cover Formulation</head><p>Given a relation R, and a view V , we create an instance of the set cover problem as follows: Construct the universal set U = R − V . Consider the set of single-attribute predicates P such that P ∈ P iff P (R) ⊇ V . For each P ∈ P we define a set</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">SP = U − (P (R) ∩ (R − V )).</formula><p>Intuitively, our aim is to cover all the elements of U , thereby eliminating all the incorrect tuples. We perform this cover by selecting a set of predicates T ⊆ P such that ∪P ∈T SP = U . In other words, a cover of U gives a solution to the EVD for R and V : Since every element of U is covered, the corresponding set of predicates in conjunction does not select any tuple in R−V . Moreover, each predicate selects all tuples of V .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">EVD</head><p>We first consider EVD for the family of queries CQ = . We will handle CQ subsequently. Theorem 3.3.

For each attribute, we first pick the smallest superset range in the view as a predicate. We further check if there is a single value in the range present in the relation but missing in the view. (If so, we replace the range predicate with one predicate involving = for the missing value. Note that if there are multiple values missing within the range, then there is no EVD.) This check can be done in O(N ) per attribute (O(M N ) overall) by using hashing to count the number of distinct values. We then check if the conjunctive clause thus formed is an EVD.</p><p>Require: A 1 , A 2 , . . . , An ← attributes of relation and view</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Require: b 1 , b 2 , . . . , bn ← sizes of view attribute domains Require: V ← view instance, R ← relation instance 1: Q ← NULL 2: for i ∈ 1 . . . n do 3: if b i == 1 then 4: v i ← value of A i in view 5: Q ← Q ∧ (A i = v i ) 6: end if 7: end for 8: if |Q(R)| == |V | then 9: return Q 10: else 11: return No EVD 12: end if</formula><p>Algorithm 2: Algorithm to solve EVD for CQ=.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">BVD</head><p>We start this section by a straightforward upper bound for BVD. We then present a lower bound, followed by an approximation algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Upper Bound</head><p>Let us consider the BVD problem for input R with N tuples and M attributes, and view V . To obtain an upper bound for BVD, we simply consider all possible conjunctive queries over R and pick the best possible one. R has O(N M ) or O(N 2M ) queries depending on whether our family of queries is CQ = or CQ. In O(M N ) we can compute d(Q(R), V ) for each query. If we assume the schema size M to be a fixed parameter and vary N , the size of the data, BVD's data complexity is PTIME, established by the following theorem. (We note that if R and V are cross-products of sets of values for attributes, BVD can be solved in O(M N ). Details of this special case appear in Appendix B.2.) Theorem 3.4. Given a relation R, view instance V , the BVD problem has a data complexity of O(M N M +1 ) and O(M N 2M +1 ) for the family of queries CQ = and CQ respectively.</p><p>Example 3.5. For Example 2.1, the BVD query for CQ= is (Director = Q.Tarantino ∧ Box Office = Hit), which has d = 2 due to two missing tuples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lower Bound</head><p>We have seen an upper bound on the complexity of BVD. Our next result shows an exponential lower bound in terms of combined data and schema complexity of R. Recall that on fixing the number of attributes, the data complexity is polynomial in N . However, if we allow the number of attributes and the number of tuples in R to both vary, we show intractability. Our proof uses a relation R where the number of tuples and number of attributes are polynomials of each other.</p><p>Theorem 3.6. Given R and V , the BVD problem is NPHard in N and M , for CQ = and CQ.</p><p>Proof. We give a reverse construction based on the idea from Section 3.2.1. That is, for each instance of the set cover problem, we construct an instance of the BVD problem such that the solution of the BVD instance yields a solution to the set cover problem. Given an instance of the set cover problem consisting of the universal set U = {1, . . . , n}, and subsets S1, . . . , Sm, we construct an input to BVD as follows (Note that the set cover problem is NP-hard even when the number of sets m is restricted to a polynomial of n): R(A1, . . . , Am) contains a tuple ti corresponding to each element i ∈ U . ti.Aj = 0 if i ∈ Sj. For every attribute value in R not assigned 0 based on the rule above, a distinct attribute value is assigned. (Note that there is no tuple marked with 0 in all attribute values, since we can assume without loss of generality that every element i ∈ U appears in some subset Sj.) Add a special tuple t0 to R where ∀j, t0.Aj = 0. Let V = {t0}.</p><p>Since V has a single tuple with all attribute values being 0, for BVD, we only need to consider queries with predicates of the form Aj = 0. Every such predicate corresponds to picking a set Sj for the set cover. Our goal reduces to finding the fewest such predicates such that each of the tuples t1, . . . , tn is not picked by at least one predicate, which is equivalent to finding the smallest cover for U .</p><p>The size of our constructed relation R is O(mn), where the set cover problem has n elements and m attributes. Hence, BVD is NP-hard in combined data and schema size.</p></div>

Suppose we are given a threshold τ along with R and V , and we want the most succinct query Q that guarantees d(Q(R), V ) ≤ τ . We can approximately solve AVD using our set cover construction when we impose the condition that Q(R) ⊇ V , which we call the AVD-Sup problem: Given R and V , we construct an instance of the set cover problem as in Section 3.2.1. We are then interested in a solution that covers at least δ = (|R − V | − τ ) elements. Once again, we can use set cover's greedy approximation algorithm. However, we must solve the set cover for all possible choices of δ elements from the |R − V | elements. We solve these |R−V | δ ≤ N τ set cover problems and pick the best, i.e., smallest, query among all of them. Theorem 3.9.

We give a reduction from the NP-complete Vertex Cover problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>: Given an undirected graph G(V, E), V = {v1, . . . , vm} and E = {e1, . . . , en}, determine the smallest set Vcov ⊆ V such that all edges in E have at least one endpoint in Vcov. The vertex cover problem is NPcomplete in N , when m and n are poly(N ).

All other entries in R are assigned distinct values. Further, let the view V = R. Now, to construct a solution to BVD, the only useful conjunctive clauses are of the form (Aj = 0), which corresponds to selecting vertex vj in the vertex cover. Any vertex cover can be represented as a union of conjunctive clauses corresponding to each vertex. Hence, there exists a vertex cover of size k if and only if there is a UCQ with k conjunctive clauses solving BVD. It is easy to see that the decision version of the problem is in NP, hence BVD is NP-complete in the size of the data and schema.</p><p>Note that the same hardness proof above holds even if the metric for succinctness is not the number of unions, but is instead the total number of predicates in the DNF formula. The proof holds because only conjunctive clauses of size 1 are useful in the above reduction. As a result, both the metrics are equivalent (i.e., the total number of predicates = total number of clauses).</p></div>

There are two main results in this section: a greedy approximation algorithm for BVD (Section 5.2.1), and an inapproximability result on a family of greedy algorithms (Section 5.2.2).

SINGLE EQUALITY PREDICATE</head><p>Consider the problem of finding a query with a selection condition consisting of a single conjunctive clause containing one predicate, i.e., query families CQ 1 = and CQ 1 . In this case all queries are of the same size, and therefore are all equally desirable. Therefore, we try to find the query Q in each of these query families that minimizes d(Q(R), V ). This query would then be the BVD for this family. If in fact the BVD query Q is such that d(Q(R), V ) = 0, then Q is also an EVD. Additionally, if d(Q(R), V ) ≤ τ , then Q is also an AVD -Note that the second condition in the AVD problem definition is trivially true because Q1 Q2 is true for all queries (since all queries are equivalent). Thus, we now proceed to give algorithms to find the BVD for each subfamily of the family of Single Predicate Conjunctive Queries.</p><p>We now introduce some notation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1 EVD</head><p>Proof of Theorem 3.3: Let us assume that an EVD query Q ∈ CQ = exists. If the cardinality of attribute Ai in the view V is 1 (i.e., Ai = vi for some vi for all tuples in V ), then we can add Ai = vi as a predicate to Q (i.e., Q ← Q ∧ (Ai = vi)), if it is not already present, without changing Q(R). Also note that if cardinality of Ai in V &gt; 1, then Q cannot have Ai = v for any v, because then Q(R) = V since some tuples in V are not selected by Q. Thus any EVD Q can be converted into one of the form Q = ∧i(Ai = vi) over all Ai that have cardinality 1 in the view. In Algorithm 2, the constructed query Q is precisely Q above. Now all that is remaining is to check if Q (R) = V for existence of an EVD, because any other EVD Q, if it exists, can be converted into Q with Q(R) = Q (R).</p><p>Checking if each attribute is a constant in the view can be done in O(N ) and for all attributes in O(M N ). Computing Q(R) is O(M N ). Thus overall, we have O(M N ) complexity.2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2 BVD for CQ: Cross Product Special Case</head><p>Next we examine the special case when both the relation R and the view V are formed as cross products of sets of attributes. For example, the relation could be all tuples of the form {1, 2} × {1, 2}, and the view could be the tuples {1, 2} × {1}.</p><p>Formally, let A1, A2, . . . , An be the attributes of R. If Ai takes values from the set Ai, then R = A1 × A2 × . . . × An. Additionally, we assume that the view is a cross product as well: V = B1 × B2 × . . . × Bn, where Ai in the view takes its values from the set Bi ⊆ Ai. Additionally, assume that |A1| =|A2| = . . .= |An| = m. Let |Bi| = bi. WLOG, assume that b1 ≥ b2 ≥ . . . ≥ bn. We have the following theorem:</p><p>Theorem B.1. If R and V are both cross products as described above, and if the size of the sets Ai are all equal to m, then Algorithm 4 returns a solution to the BVD for CQ = in O(M N ).</p><p>Proof. In a conjunctive query Q, for each attribute Ai, there are two possible cases: either the attribute is given a value, or the attribute is not present in the conjunctive clause. If the attribute is given a value v, we let Ci = {v}, else let Ci = Ai. Clearly, Q(R) = C1 × C2 × . . . × Cn.</p><p>For each attribute Ai, consider three numbers fi, gi and hi, where fi = |Bi − Ci|, gi = |Ci − Bi|, and hi = |Bi ∩ Ci|.</p><p>The difference d(V, Q(R)) would then be the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">d = extra + missing = (Πi(fi + hi) − Πihi) + (Πi(gi + hi) − Πihi) = c + Πi(gi + hi) − 2Πihi</formula><p>where c is a constant independent of the conjunctive clause chosen.</p><p>We now wish to find the optimal set of gi, hi to minimize the number above. Clearly, for each attribute i, we either have (1) gi +hi = m, and hi = bi (2) gi +hi = 1, and hi = 1.</p><p>If we choose k attributes to give values to in the conjunctive clause, Πi(gi + hi) will be m k , but Πihi will be atmost b1 · b2 · . . . · b k . Thus our candidates for the best conjunctive clause are precisely those which select a value (1) for An from Bn, or (2) for An from Bn and for An−1 from Bn−1, or (3) . . ., or (n) for An from Bn and for An−1 from Bn−1 and . . . and for A1 from B1. These are precisely the conjunctive clauses considered in Algorithm 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.1 CQs with a single predicate</head><p>In this section, we describe how to find the BVD-Sup for the family of queries CQ 1 = . For any attribute Ai that is a constant in the view V , let the domain Ai be {1, 2, . . . mi}. Let the proportion of tuples with value j for attribute Ai be p j i in the relation R. Let Ai = j for all tuples in the view. Then, if we were to pick Ai = j as the conjunctive clause Q, then d(V, Q(R)) would be: di = p j i * |R| − |V | We simply pick the conjunctive clause corresponding to attribute Ai that minimizes di above. Let this value di be dmin. If there is no such conjunctive clause, we return the conjunctive clause true. We have the following theorem:</p><p>Theorem E.1. Given a relation instance R and a view instance V , the procedure above finds the BVD-Sup over queries in CQ 1 = in O(M N ). Proof. Since all queries in CQ 1 = have atmost one attribute given one value, we need to consider all single-attribute queries that are supersets of the view V . If an attribute Ai has more than one value in the view V , then no conjunctive clause of the form Ai = vi would be permissible, because they would not include all the tuples in the view V . Thus we can only consider queries formed from attributes that are constants in the view V . Those are precisely the queries considered above.</p><p>The procedure above makes one pass of each column to check if the attribute values are the same O(M N ), plus one pass per attribute to compute p j i , O(M N ), thus we have a time complexity of O(M N ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.2 CQs with multiple predicates</head><p>The results in this section assume that the size is the same for all conjunctive queries.</p><p>We find the solution to the BVD-Sup problem for queries in CQ = by picking all attributes that have a single value in the view V , and taking their conjunction. That is, if Ai = vi for all tuples in the view V , we add (Ai = vi) as a predicate to the conjunctive query. We add all such predicates to the BVD-Sup query Q.</p><p>Theorem E.2. Given a relation instance R and a view instance V , the procedure above finds the BVD-Sup over queries in CQ = in O(M N ).</p><p>Proof. Let the best query be Q. We can only make Q "better" by adding additional predicates (thereby constraining it further) as long as we maintain V ⊆ Q(R). Thus, if we add the predicate Ai = vi for all i where Ai has a single value vi for all tuples in the view, then we make Q only better. Also note that no predicate corresponding to Aj for which there are multiple values in the tuples in the view V can appear in Q, because otherwise V ⊆ Q(R) would be violated (since some tuples would be missed). Thus the best query will contain Ai = vi for all attributes with a single value in the V , and no predicates corresponding to other attributes, since all attributes are covered, and since a conjunctive clause can have at most one predicate per attribute.</p><p>The procedure above makes one pass of each column to check if the attribute values are the same, so we have a complexity of O(M N ).</p><p>For the BVD-Sup queries in CQ, we form a conjunctive clause with one range corresponding to each attribute, where the range is between the values that are the minimum and maximum values for the given attribute in the view.</p><p>Theorem E.3. Given a relation instance R and a view instance V , the procedure above finds the BVD-Sup over queries in CQ = in O(M N ).</p><p>Proof. Trivially, the conjunctive clause described above covers all the tuples in the view V . We need to prove that there is no other query that is smaller that covers all the tuples in the view V . If in a new "smaller" query if there is an attribute that is assigned a range that excludes some elements from the range <ref type="bibr">[min, max]</ref>, then it would be missing some tuples from V . Thus the query selected above is the best possible.</p><p>The procedure above makes one pass of each column to find the min and the max attribute values for each attribute, so we have a complexity of O(M N ).</p></div>

The complexity of BVD-Sub on CQ = is O(M N M +1 ) and on CQ is O(M N 2M +1 ). Example 6.14.

Consider range predicates, i.e., for any attribute Ai, we could have the query Q = j ≤ Ai ≤ k. Let the proportion of tuples with values in [j, k] for attribute Ai be p j,k i in the relation R and q j,k i in the view V . Thus, we would have d(V, Q(R)) = d j,k i = p j,k i * |R| − q j,k i * |V | + (1 − q j,k i ) * |V | Let the attribute Ai and values j, k be the ones that mini- mizes d j,k i above over all 1 ≤</figDesc></figure>

Suppose for i = j, Qi and Qj don't share any good elements. Further, suppose all Qi have the identical set of N k bad elements. Then, by picking these k conjunctive queries we get a total of (N − k) good elements and N k bad elements, thus gbopt ≥ (N (1 − 1 k ) − k), giving the required result. (2) Construct an input such that there exists one special conjunctive query Q * with N good tuples and (N − N k ) bad tuples. That is, Q * covers all elements in V d but also has N − N k elements in R d − V d . In addition, consider k con- junctive queries Q1, . . . , Q k , each consisting of N k good tu- ples and 1 bad tuple. Further, let the k sets of good tuples be completely disjoint, and this cover V d completely, and let all of Q1, . . . , Q k have the same one bad tuple. In the construction above: ∀i : gb(Q * ) = N k &gt; gb(Qi) = ( N k − 1) Therefore, the greedy solution picks Q * and stops after that, achieving d greedy = (N − N k ), where as dopt = 1. Therefore, r d = N (1 − 1 k ). 2</figDesc></figure>
