			<abstract>
				<p>A matrix giving the traffic volumes between origin and destination in a network has tremendously potential utility for network capacity planning and management. Unfortunately, traffic matrices are generally unavailable in large operational IP networks. On the other hand, link load measurements are readily available in IP networks. In this paper, we propose a new method for practical and rapid inference of traffic matrices in IP networks from link load measurements, augmented by readily available network and routing configuration information. We apply and validate the method by computing backbone-router to backbone-router traffic matrices on a large operational tier-1 IP network-a problem an order of magnitude larger than any other comparable method has tackled. The results show that the method is remarkably fast and accurate, delivering the traffic matrix in under five seconds.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A fundamental obstacle to developing sound methods for network and traffic engineering in operational IP networks today is the inability of network operators to measure the traffic matrix. A traffic matrix provides, for every ingress point over a given time interval. Taken together with network topology, routing and fault data, the traffic matrix can provide a great deal of help in the diagnosis and management of network congestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. On longer time scales, traffic matrices are critical inputs to network design, capacity planning and business planning.</p><p>Unfortunately, today's production systems for IP network measurement do not provide the inputs needed for direct computation of IP traffic matrices. Instead, these systems gather data on:</p><p>Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Though these measurements may reveal traffic anomalies or congestion problems, they do not in general reveal potential solutions. For instance, link load measurements may reveal congestion on a link, but shed little light on its cause, which in general requires understanding the traffic matrix.</p><p>The principal contribution of this paper is a simple, efficient, and accurate method for computing traffic matrix estimates for IP networks, from widely available data: link load and network routing and configuration data. The method draws on ideas from "gravity modeling" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> and "tomographic methods" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. It also makes use of network configuration data to dramatically reduce computational complexity.</p><p>We have validated the method against direct traffic matrix measurements from detailed flow level data on an operational tier-1 IP network, and the results show very good accuracy. It also has the appealing characteristic that additional information, say from flow level traces, may be included in a straight forward manner. The method is very fast, taking less than 5 seconds on a 336 MHz Ultrasparc-II processor to compute a backbone-router to backbone-router traffic matrix on the tier-1 IP network. The method, and its gravity model prior have been used in that network since 2001 for a variety of tasks ranging from traffic engineering to router/link failure analysis to capacity planning, with considerable success.</p><p>At their simplest, gravity models are based on the assumption of a simple proportionality relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> , quantities that can be obtained by summing link load data at the network edge. (See Section 3.1.) The gravity model assumes that the traffic component from or to a given site depends only the total traffic entering or leaving that site. By appropriate normalization, the gravity model solution is guaranteed to be consistent with measured link loads at the network edge, but not necessarily so in the interior links. Alternatively, tomographic methods are based on the system of linear equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">$ &amp; % ( ' 0 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where ) is the traffic matrix (written as a column vector), $ represents link loads, and <ref type="bibr">'</ref> the network routing matrix -see Section 3.2 for details. In essence, equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> states that the traffic matrix must be consistent with network routing and measured link loads throughout the network, not just at the edge. However, this matrix equality is highly under-constrained, and so allows many solutions. Tomographic methods differ in how a single "best" solution is identified from the possibilities. The majority of existing statistical tomography 1 approaches (commonly referred to as "network tomography" methods) use models of the higher order statistics of the link load data to create additional constraints. In contrast, optimization-based tomography approaches (e.g., linear or quadratic programming) often attempt to find a solution that optimizes an objective function.</p><p>The method introduced in this paper refines and combines both gravity and tomographic methods:</p><p>1. We solve the gravity model using edge link load data. Additional information on routing between points of ingress and egress for traffic flows can be incorporated to obtain significant improvements. In the numerical results presented here, we incorporate information to model traffic exchanged with peer networks (Section 3.1.2).</p><p>2. As the final estimate of the traffic matrix, we apply quadratic programming to determine the solution in the space of those admitted by the tomography model closest to the solution obtained by the gravity model. This step utilizes all available link load data, and does not require (higher-order) statistics or additional traffic modeling assumptions. The key computational challenge is to compute the pseudo-inverse of the routing matrix 2 , which has high dimensionality. To overcome this challenge, we apply network configuration and routing data to dramatically decrease the problem dimension. Iterative proportional fitting is used to ensure the non-negativity of the results.</p><p>We term this method for computing IP traffic matrices the tomogravity method, for want of a better name.</p><p>The validation of the tomogravity method is based on a set of hourly traffic matrices derived from direct flow level measurements using the methodology described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. These traffic matrices cover over 2/3 of a tier-1 IP backbone network (including all the peering traffic) over June 2002. Obtaining direct flow level measurement across large IP networks today is a far more taxing and complex task than link and router configuration measurement, due to limited and inconsistent router support for flow level measurement capabilities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> provides an indication of the accuracy of the method. The method is remarkably accurate for the all but the smallest entries in the traffic matrix. We note that the larger values in the traffic matrix dominate network and traffic engineering applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The majority of the traffic lies within 3 23% relative error, and a more than 30% of the matrix elements have negligible error.</p><p>A more detailed examination of the data will show that the relative errors are largest for the smallest matrix elements, which fortunately do not have large absolute errors in general and are thus unlikely to matter in applications. The matrix elements of most importancethe largest values -are the most accurate. Further, all of the errors were found to be well-behaved, that is none have overly large absolute errors, and they vary smoothly over time, meaning their impact on operational tasks will not be dramatic, even where the errors are largest.</p><p>Even more importantly from an operations perspective, predictions based on the estimated traffic matrix are remarkably accurate. For instance, the relative accuracy of computed link loads based on the estimated traffic matrix are within a few percent of the real link loads. The method insures this will be the case, but interestingly, other results such as the distribution functions for the sizes of traffic matrix elements based on real and estimated data are almost indistinguishable as well.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: we start in Section 2 with basic network concepts and terminology, and the features of the data we have available. This is followed by a detailed description of the tomogravity method in Section 3. The next section (Section 4) presents our validation results of the method, based on real network traffic matrices. Finally we conclude the paper in Section 5. %.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>Tomographic methods have been widely and successfully applied, for example, in Computer Aided Tomography (CAT) scans, used in medical imaging. These methods differ in how they deal with the under-determination of the system of tomographic constraint equations. Optimization-based tomography approaches typically find a solution that optimizes an objective function, whereas network tomography approaches often use the higher order statistics of the link load data to create additional constraints.</p><p>Vardi <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> first put the ideas of network tomography into practice for computing traffic matrices in communications networks, with subsequent contributions by Tebaldi and West <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and by Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. There is a dual of this problem also referred to as network tomography in which link performance metrics are determined from path measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, but this does not directly concern us here.</p><p>Network tomography, in some sense, comprises determining the solution ) to equation (2), or at least the parameters of some model of Directly solving (3) for finitely many measurements is problematic. Due to statistical variability of the $ and U , the equations are generally inconsistent, while some of the W X Â¥ may be negative. To circumvent these problems, Vardi employed an iterative approach that uses the EM algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to find approximate solutions. In the approach of Cao et al., a modified EM algorithm is used directly to find maximal likelihood parameters in the Gaussian model. Convergence is hastened by using second-order methods. Even with such methods, the complexity of the network tomography approaches grows as is claimed for topologies in which the ingress-egress pairs can be partitioned over mostly disjoint regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">b c @ A d f e F E ,</formula><p>Furthermore, Medina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> shows that the basic assumptions underlying the statistical models (Poisson or Gaussian) are not justified, and that the methods above may perform badly when their underlying assumptions are violated. The paper concluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> that none of the prior methods for computing traffic matrices was satisfactory for even a PoP to PoP traffic matrix on a large network, let alone a BR to BR matrix.</p><p>An alternative that is well known in social sciences for modeling commodity exchanges is the gravity model (See, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>). In network applications, gravity models have been used to model mobility in wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and the volume of telephone calls in a network <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Recently, variants of gravity models have been proposed for computing IP network traffic matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposes an approach based on using the choice models to model PoP fanouts, which can be viewed as a variant of the gravity model approach. The paper also suggests using their method to generate priors to serve as inputs to statistical tomography techniques, but does not test this idea. An alternative generalization of the gravity model (detailed below) that explicitly models inter-peer routing was used by the authors of this current paper in capacity planning exercises in 2001 for an operational IP network.</p><p>As noted above, gravity models are typically based on edge data, and as such do not guarantee consistency with the observed link loads on the interior of the network. Of course, in their full generality, gravity models can indeed include such information through the use of the elements in the traffic matrix), but the number of computations is actually rather small per term, and so these methods are fast on even the largest network sizes. Hence gravity models are quite appealing, but we shall demonstrate the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> can be significantly improved by incorporating information from the internal link measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Network</head><p>An IP network is made up of IP routers and IP adjacencies between those routers, within a single autonomous system or administrative domain. It is natural to think of the network as a set of nodes and links, associated with the routers and adjacencies, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>. We refer to nodes and links that are wholly internal to the network as backbone nodes and links, and refer to the others as edge nodes and links.</p><p>In addition, it is helpful for IP networks managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to further classify the edge. As shown in the figure, in general the network will connect to other autonomous systems and customers via edge links. We categorize the edge links into access links, connecting customers, and peering links, which connect other (non-customer) autonomous systems. A significant fraction of the traffic in an ISP is inter-domain and is exchanged between cus- tomers and peer networks. Traffic to peer networks is today largely focused on dedicated peering links, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>. Under the typical routing policies implemented by large ISPs, very little traffic will transit the backbone from one peer network to another. Transit traffic between peers may reflect a temporary step in network consolidation following an ISP merger or acquisition, but should not occur under normal operating circumstances.</p><p>In large IP networks, distributed routing protocols are used to build the forwarding tables within each router. It is possible to predict the results of these distributed computations, from data gathered from router configuration files. (The results provided here are based on router configuration files downloaded once daily). In our investigation, we employ a routing simulator such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that makes use of statically configured Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) topology information gleaned from the configuration files. In operational IP networks, this information is quite stable on the time scales of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Traffic Data</head><p>In IP networks today, link load measurements are readily available via the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is unique in that it is supported by essentially every device in an IP network. The SNMP data that is available on a device is defined in a abstract data structure known as a Management Information Base (MIB). An SNMP poller periodically requests the appropriate SNMP MIB data from a router (or other device). Since every router maintains a cyclic counter of the number of bytes transmitted and received on each of its interfaces, we can obtain basic traffic statistics for the entire network with little additional infrastructure support -all we need is an SNMP poller that periodically records these counters.</p><p>The properties of data gathered via SNMP are important for implementation of a useful algorithm -SNMP data has many limitations. Data may be lost in transit (SNMP uses unreliable UDP transport; copying to our research archive may introduce loss). Data may be incorrect (through poor router vendor implementations). The sampling interval is coarse (in our case 5 minutes). Many of the typical problems in SNMP data may be removed with minimal artifacts using simple techniques. For instance, using hourly traffic averages (with five minute data polls) mitigates the effect of missing data substantially. Slightly more sophisticated methods of anomaly detection and interpolation produce even better results, but we shall use simple hourly data for the purposes of this study, as hourly (or longer) data are commonly dealt with by many ISPs (with five minute or finer data kept for brief periods for trouble-shooting and alarming).</p><p>We use flow level data in this paper for validation purposes. This data is collected at the router which aggregates traffic by IP source and destination address, and TCP port numbers. This level of granularity is sufficient to obtain a real traffic matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and in the future such measurement may provide direct traffic matrix measurements, but at present limitations in vendor implementations prevent collection of this data from the entire network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Terminology</head><p>For the purpose of computing traffic matrices, without loss of generality, we assume that all access and peering links terminate at Edge Routers (ERs), and that all remaining routers are Backbone Routers (BRs) that only terminate backbone links. (We can always insert dummy ERs to force the assumption to be true.) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> provides a simplified network topology to illustrate the terminology We make a further distinction that links between BRs are core links, and links between ER and BR are non-core links.  in a similar manner, where the elements refer to traffic entering and leaving the core. We will often refer to a vector form of the traffic matrix ) in which the indices of the vector refer to source/destination pairs.</p><p>There may be more than one route between two routers even using only shortest paths. We assume that traffic will be evenly distributed across all such routes (though our method can be easily adapted to handle uneven distributions).</p><p>One could compute traffic matrices with different levels of aggregation at the source and destination endpoints, for instance, at the level of PoP to PoP, or router to router, or link to link <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In this paper, we are primarily interested in computing router to router traffic matrices, which are appropriate for a number of network and traffic engineering applications, and can be used to construct more highly aggregated traffic matrices (e.g. PoP to PoP) using routing information <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">SOLUTION</head><p>In this section we provide our method, termed tomogravity, for computing the traffic matrix from link data. As its name indicates, the method consists of two basic steps -a gravity modeling step, and a tomographic estimation step:</p><p>1. In the gravity modeling step, an initial solution is obtained by solving a gravity model using edge link load data. We also incorporate static ISP routing policy information and explicitly model the traffic exchanged with peer networks.</p><p>2. In the tomographic estimation step, the initial solution is refined by applying quadratic programming to find a solution that minimizes the distance to the initial solution (in weighted leastsquare sense) subject to the tomographic constraints. We also apply knowledge of the network routing and topology configuration to significantly reduce the problem size. Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) is used to ensure non-negativity of the results.</p><p>Below we discuss each step in a separate subsection, followed by a brief summary of the complete algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Gravity Modeling</head><p>One of the simplest approaches to computing a traffic matrix is the gravity model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Gravity models, taking their name from Newton's law of gravitation, are commonly used by social scientists to model the movement of people, goods or information between geographic areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. In Newton's law of gravitation the force is proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects divided by the distance squared. Similarly, in gravity models for cities, the relative strength of the interaction between two cities might be modeled as proportional to the product of the populations. A general formulation of a gravity model is given by the following equation: friction factors is an equivalent problem of the same size as the inference of the traffic matrix itself. Accordingly, it is necessary to approximate the actual friction matrix using models with fewer parameters. In this paper, we shall assume a common constant for the friction factors, which is arguably the simplest among all possible approximation schemes. The resulting gravity model simply states that the traffic exchanged between locations is proportional to the volumes entering and exiting at those locations. Our results show that, remarkably, this gravity model when combined with detailed knowledge of ISP routing policies, is able to match the actual Internet data very well. One possible explanation for this is that geographic locality is not a major factor in today's Internet, as compared to ISP routing policies. As long as the gravity model captures the essence of the routing policies, it becomes very accurate and the choice of the friction factors is less critical.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">6 7 Â¥ P Â© % d x Â¥ Â 2 Â Â© Â Â¥ Â Â© (4)</formula><p>Note that we do not expect our gravity model to accurately model the traffic between all source-destination pairs. In fact, one would naturally expect certain pairs of locations to stand out from the overall distribution, simply due to their specific characteristics (e.g. going through transoceanic links). A key insight of the tomogravity method is that we only need the gravity model to capture the overall distribution; we expect the tomographic estimation step to correct most of the violations in the assumptions underlying the gravity model and thus significantly improving the overall accuracy. It is certainly possible to further improve the method by using more accurate gravity models with additional parameters. However, as we show later in Section 4.3, the tomogravity method in its current simple form is already remarkably accurate. The margin for improvement may be limited.</p><p>Another important issue concerning the gravity model is the level of aggregation. Intuitively, we need the aggregation level to be sufficiently high so that the traffic exchanged between different locations is not sensitive to the detailed composition of the traffic. On the other hand, when the aggregation level is too high (e.g. PoP to PoP), ISP routing policies operating at a more granular level may have a profound impact and can introduce serious systematic distortion to the overall traffic pattern. In our tomogravity method, we apply gravity models at the link to link level, which is the finest level of resolution obtainable with SNMP data. We can easily use routing information to obtain more highly aggregated traffic matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>We formally present two (link to link) gravity models below. The first one is quite simple and is primarily used to provide insight into the approach. The second approach incorporates more realistic routing assumptions, and its performance is thereby much improved over the simple model. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Generalized Gravity Model</head><p>It is possible to generalize the simple gravity model of Section 3.1.1 to take into account a wide range of additional information provided by link classification and routing policy. In this Section, we will incorporate new information to model large ISP routing policies.</p><p>Typically, in large North-American ISPs, the majority of traffic is exchanged between network customers and network peers. The patterns and handling of customer and peer traffic are qualitatively different, and this has a large impact on the traffic matrix.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Tomography</head><p>Netw Â ork tomography, as mentioned earlier, is the problem of determining the end-to-end traffic matrix from link loads. The link traffic is the sum of the traffic matrix elements that are routed across that link, and so we may see our problem as follows.

For general topologies and routing there are typically many more unknowns than constraints, and so equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2)</ref> is highly under-constrained and does not have a unique solution. In order to infer ) it is useful to adopt a traffic model of some kind -in the previous work on network tomography the model allows the addition of higher-order statistical constraints. Our approach is not to incorporate additional constraints, but rather to use the gravity model to obtain an initial estimate of the solution, which needs to be refined to satisfy the constraints. The details are presented below, but first it is important to reduce the size of the problem to make computation of the solution more manageable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Reducing the Computational Complexity</head><p>One of the main problems with practical application of any tomographic technique is the size of the routing matrix. The chosen data samples in the study cover on the order of a thousand routers, which would lead to an intractably large problem (with millions of unknowns). One approach is to deal only with smaller problems. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> examines PoP to PoP traffic matrices. In this paper, we focus on computing BR to BR traffic matrices, which are generally much more useful for traffic engineering tasks such as load balancing, and are absolutely necessary for link/router failure analysis. We can directly derive PoP to PoP traffic matrices from BR to BR matrices using routing information. However, even if we only consider backbone routers there may be of the order of one hundred, leading to a problem with over ten thousand unknowns, which is orders of magnitude more than the available constraints on link traffic volume.</p><p>In this section we develop techniques that can significantly reduce the number of unknowns (in our case by a factor of 10 for the BR to BR traffic matrix) and thus making the computation of traffic matrix both more accurate and more efficient.</p><p>Our key observation is that many BR to BR matrix elements are empty as a result of the fact that there may be multiple BRs within each PoP, and so traffic will flow only between the closest of these (as determined by IGP routing). For instance consider the simplified topology shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. Here there are two BRs in each PoP, connecting ERs within the PoP with redundant links. Given shortest path routing (and equal link weights on backbone links), one can see that all of the traffic from PoP B, to PoP C will traverse the route through BRs 2 and 3, while there will be no traffic entering the backbone nodes at BR 1 and departing at BR 4. While this is a very simple example, in operational IP networks, the set of paths consistent with IP routing will typically be significantly less than the set of all paths between router pairs.</p><p>Consider . We use the following simple algorithm for removing all the empty demands:</p><p>1 Initially mark all elements of the BR to BR traffic matrix as empty 2 For each pair of ERs simulate the IGP as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>  that remain empty. This step is equivalent to removing elements from ) that will be zero because the corresponding route is not used (unless failures occur). We can exploit the topological equivalence of ERs to avoid having to run IGP simulations for all possible pairs of routers, which can be prohibitive due to their large number. We consider two ERs to be topologically equivalent if they connect to the same (non-empty) set of BRs and the IGP weights on the corresponding links are the same <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . We group such equivalent edge routers together, and consider them as a single Edge Router Equivalence Class (EREC). The key observation is that the routes between the component ERs of the same pair of ERECs will be the same except for the first and last links. Consequently, we only need to run one IGP simulation for each pair of ERECs. We found that computing routes on this basis reduces the computational burden by at least a factor of 20.</p><p>After eliminating all the empty demands we are able to reduce the number of unknowns by a factor of 10, thereby turning a highly under-constrained problem into a moderately under-constrained problem, while making the computation orders of magnitude faster.</p><p>The routing matrix is required for all methods except the simple gravity model. The time taken in computing the routing matrix dominates all other algorithms we use, taking two to three minutes. However, note that this cost can often be amortized over multiple traffic matrix computations because we only need to recompute the routing matrix when the network topology changes. The algorithm to reduce the problem size can be performed as part of computing the routing matrix, with a computational cost that is a very small marginal cost on top of computing the routing matrix itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Quadratic Programming</head><p>From the (link to link) gravity model, we can easily obtain an estimate of the BR to BR traffic matrix (w y ) using routing information <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The link to link traffic matrix elements are routed across the backbone, and we then compute the traffic volumes between each pair of backbone routers (note that we loose the distinction between peering and access traffic in this step). We term the resulting estimate as the gravity model solution (denoted as ) F</p><p>). We then refine the gravity model solution by using a least-square solution that minimizes the Euclidean distance to the gravity model solution subject to the tomographic constraints. More specifically, we would like to solve the following quadratic program</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Â¡ f Â¢ Â Â£ Â¤ ) Â ) F w Â¤ Â¥ `Â¦ Â§ ` Â¤ ' R Â &amp; 8 Â¤ Â¨ Â¢Â¥ Â¡ f Â¢ Â Â£ Â© Â¢ Â Â¡ f Â¢ Â Âª S Â« S Â¬ where Â¤ t ` Â© Â¤</formula><p>is the Â h norm of a vector (i.e., the Euclidean distance to the origin).</p><p>We also investigate weighted least-squares solutions in which the projection onto the subspace is not orthogonal, but rather weighted by a function of the size of the estimated traffic matrix elements (  as the objective function to minimize in the above quadratic program, where Â® is the weight vector, and Â­ is the element-by-element vector division. We investigate three weighting schemes in this paper; the weight for each term of the traffic matrix is either: constant, linearly proportional to the terms in the gravity model traffic matrix, or proportional to the square root of the gravity model. Â There may be a multiple layer hierarchy of ERs within a PoP, and lower layer ERs pass traffic to BRs only through the higher layer ERs. We may remove the lower layer of ERs from consideration as we see their (network impacting) traffic at the higher layer. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the approach in a simple case with two unknowns Â¯ (unknown traffic along two routes), and one constraint (one known link load). The constraint(s) specify a sub-space of the parameter space (in this case just a line), while the gravity model is one particular solution. The simple least-squares approach is just an orthogonal projection of the gravity model solution onto the constraint sub-space. The weighted least-squares solution gives different weights to different unknowns in the solution. Note that the tomographic constraints may be ill-posed due to possible dependency among different link constraints. Furthermore, the constraints may not be satisfiable due to error and noise in the link load data or possible routing changes that are not captured by the topology data. The standard technique for dealing with ill-posed quadratic programs is to use Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD) of the routing matrix <ref type="bibr">'</ref> to compute its pseudo-inverse. The resulting solution is the closest to the initial solution ) i among all solutions that minimize the discrepancy against the tomographic constraints (</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Â¤ Â ' R Â Â¨ 8 Â¤ )</formula><p>. Routines to compute the pseudo-inverse are available in many numerical computing packages (for instance see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). We have implemented our method in Matlab, and the actual algorithm is so simple that it only takes 6 lines of code (see the Appendix).</p><p>The worst case complexity of the above algorithm is linear in the number of unknowns (elements of the traffic matrix), and quadratic in the number of constraints, however, in practice the complexity of singular value decomposition methods is generally less than this. For instance the SVD used in LAPACK <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and thence Matlab (which uses these routines) are usually better than this complexity estimate would indicate. In reality, the algorithm is very fast, with the computation times on a 336 MHz Ultrasparc-II processor (running Solaris 7) all significantly under 2 seconds.</p><p>One additional locus of complexity is that the least-square algorithm may result in negative values, which are without physical meaning. One can avoid this by viewing the problem as a constrained optimization problem. However, a simple iterative procedure provides a fast and effective alternative. Specifically, we use Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to ensure non-negativity. We do not model higher order statistics of the process, and therefore, the initial condition we use is not as complex as that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For the initial estimate, we simply use the traffic matrix estimated above, with zero replacing the negative elements of the matrix. IPF then proceeds by successively refining the estimate using the same method as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In practice it only takes a few iterations to reduce errors in the constraint equations to the point at which they are negligible.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">VALIDATION</head><p>In this section, we validate our methods using actual Internet data. We first describe the basic validation methodology. We then validate the underlying assumptions for the gravity models we use. This is followed by a detailed comparison of the quality of the results obtained by different methods. Finally, we present some preliminary results on the robustness of the tomogravity method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Methodology</head><p>In an ideal environment, we would like to validate the results using a consistent set of real traffic matrix, topology, and link measurements. Unfortunately, we do not have the complete set of flow level data across the edge of the network (due to problems in the vendor implementations of flow collection). Furthermore, the routing data we have available comes in 24 hour snapshots, and the flow level data is sampled data, with its own limitations. Therefore, it is not possible for us to obtain a complete traffic and routing matrix consistent with the actual SNMP link measurements.</p><p>We solve the problem of providing a consistent set of traffic, topology and link measurement data as follows. We first derive a set of hourly (partial) traffic matrices based on direct flow level measurements using the methodology described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We then simulate OSPF routing using the topology and routing information. From this we may compute a routing matrix <ref type="bibr">'</ref> , and then derive a set of link measurements for a problem for which we know the "ground truth" -the real traffic matrix. This approach has the additional advantage that it isolates the impacts of measurement errors and inconsistencies from the performance of the algorithms (the topic of this paper). We can thereby study the impact of measurement errors separately, and more precisely, as we can induce the errors, rather than infering them from multiple (possibly inconsistent) data sets.</p><p>Note that we use use derived link load measurements for validation purposes only. In practice, our method is applicable to direct link data such as one would obtain from SNMP, and we have in fact applied them directly to SNMP data for operational tasks in capacity planning and network management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Gravity Models</head><p>In this section, we validate the basic assumptions underlying our gravity models, in particular the assumption on constant friction factors, which is the simplest possible approximation to the</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">d Â± p v d fric- tion matrix.</formula><p>By simple rearrangements of the basic equations of the gravity model, it is clear that when the estimated friction factors are constant, the actual friction factors are constant if and only if the ratio between the estimated and the actual matrix elements are constant. Clearly the constant should be 1 as the gravity models maintain the correct total traffic volume through appropriate normalization. As a result, to test if the actual friction factors are constant, one only need to verify that the points</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Â² @ A 6  Â¥ P Â© B D 6 Â´ Â³ Â¥ P Â© E</formula><p>lie on a straight line passing through the origin. It is easy to show that the same analysis applies for the simple and the generalized gravity models introduced in Section 3.1.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the two link to link gravity models for one hour chosen randomly from June 2002. In each case we plot the true value of the elements of the traffic matrix versus the estimated value. Clearly, the closer the points cluster around the diagonal, the more accurate the model. It appears that the generalized gravity model is more accurate than the simple model.</p><p>To quantify the linear association between the real and the estimated matrix elements, we compute the correlation coefficient for each hourly traffic matrix, along with the least-square regression line. We need to verify two facts: Â¢ ) the correlation coefficient is close to 1 (so that the points are closely centered around the regression line), and Â¢ Â¢ ) the intercept of the regression line is close to 0. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 6</ref> shows the distribution of the correlation coefficients over the entire June 2002 dataset. For the simple gravity model, the correlation coefficient typically lies between 0.65 and 0.8, which are significant, but not as large as we would like. In contrast, the correlation coefficients for the generalized gravity model are consistently above 0.9, indicating very strong linear association.</p><p>We next compute the 95% confidence interval for the intercept of the regression line under the assumption that the regression residuals is Gaussian. We find that the 95% confidence interval covers 0 on all 507 hourly traffic matrices for both the simple and the generalized gravity model. This indicates that the intercept is indeed close to 0.</p><p>These results show that the generalized gravity model is significantly more accurate than the simple gravity model, which highlights the importance of explicitly taking into account ISP routing policies in gravity modeling. Moreover, despite its simplistic assumptions about the traffic (i.e. proportionality, and constant friction factor), the model can capture the overall distribution of the matrix elements very well. As a result, the resulting estimate can provide a good starting point for the tomographic estimation step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Performance</head><p>The main method of validation we use is to directly compare the estimated traffic matrix elements with the true traffic matrix.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2)</ref>, to demonstrate that a direct solution of the equation does not produce a good result. <ref type="figure">Figure 7 (b)</ref> shows the result of the simple gravity model, which are also fairly inaccurate overall, though better than the pure least squares approach. <ref type="figure">Figure 7 (c)</ref> shows the generalized gravity model, and we can see a dramatic improvement over the previous algorithms, though it is still not perfect. Finally, <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> (d) shows the results with the generalized gravity model, and the least-squares solution (using square root weights). This final solution appears remarkably good.</p><p>To quantify the quality of the results, it might seem ideal to establish a direct link to traffic and network engineering applications, for instance for capacity planning. However, these involve complex algorithms in their own right, and so we shall attempt to present some simple metrics for the quality of the results which have some linkage to the engineering requirements. The requirements (drawn from extensive conversation with engineers doing capacity planning and network design) can be approximately stated thus: we require reasonable relative accuracy for the larger elements of the traffic matrix, and not too large absolute errors for all matrix elements. How large is a reasonable error? In light of the other sources of error in Internet planning, and accuracy measured in a few ten's of percent is quite tolerable, especially if the errors for the larger flows are smaller. This is further backed up by work such as that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which showed that  at least one networking task (routing optimization) could still provide substantial Âµ capacity improvements even when the errors in the input traffic matrices were significantly larger than those reported here.</p><p>It seems that a single metric is unlikely to cover this adequately, so we shall present several. Two shown here are the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), defined below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">RMSE % Â Â Â¶ Â¥ q Â· 9 Â @ Â° 8 9 Â¥ Â Â Â¨ 8 9 Â¥ D Eh`( Eh` Eh`(6) RMSRE@ A Â¤ Â E % Â Â x Â¶ Â¥ A Â· 9 Â Â¸ S n Â Â¹ x Â° 8 9 Â¥ Â Â &amp; 8 ! Â¥ 8 9 Â¥ h ` (7)</formula><p>The RMSE gives an overall metric for the errors in the estimates, and the RMSRE gives a relative measure, but note that the relative errors for small matrix elements are not really important for engineering, and so we when computing the RMSRE we take only matrix elements greater than some threshold Â¤ (and therefore when computing the mean normalized by the number of matrix elements greater than</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Â¤ , namely Â x % Â¶ Â¥ A Â· 9 Â Â§ Â¸ nÂ¹ x Â</formula><p>). We compute these metrics not just to compare the errors in the traffic matrices themselves, but also to compare the observables. That is we use the estimated traffic matrix to predict the link loads on core links, and compare with the real load on these links. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the results for the different possible algorithms -in these results Â¤ is chosen so that 75% of the traffic is capture by the RMSRE. Note that this truncation removes elements of the traffic matrix whose magnitude is at most 5% of the capacity of the smallest link the the backbone network being considered. Hence, even quite large relative errors can be tolerated in these terms as long as the errors are not highly correlated (which should be guaranteed by satisfying the tomographic constraints).</p><p>The first three columns of the table specify the algorithm by its initial conditions, whether the LSE method is applied, and if it is, what weights are used. The quality metrics above are presented both for the errors in the estimated traffic matrix, and the estimated core link traffic, and are based on our entire set of data for June 2002 (though there are missing days in this data set the data set still contains over 500 one hour intervals of data).</p><p>The RMSE results are quoted in Mbps and these may all seem relatively small in comparison to the scale of the network -the backbone consists primarily of reasonably well utilized OC48 and OC192 links (2.5 and 10 Gbps respectively), but in particular note their relative values for comparison. The link errors are not as interesting as the traffic matrix errors in some respects, because there are many possible (incorrect) solutions which can produce the correct counts. However, it is important from a practical standpoint to get these at least approximately correct, and the results show that without a tomographic component, the link traffic estimates may be quite inaccurate. When a tomographic component is used the errors in the link loads are of the same magnitude as the targeted error level used in the IPF component of the algorithm, as required.</p><p>The results uniformly show 2 that (a) the simple gravity model is better than the raw least-squares algorithm, and that (b) using the least-squares with a gravity model initial condition provides a definite improvement, not just in the estimated link rates (which is what the method directly improves), but also in the traffic matrix estimates. Further the generalized gravity model is better than the simple gravity model. However the best result comes from tomogravity, using the generalized gravity model with the weighted least-squares method using square root weights (though the improvement over using other h Other performance metrics investigated uniformly support the conclusion drawn from <ref type="table">Table 1.</ref> weightings is small).</p><p>The statistics above appear to favor using the square root weighting scheme presented above. We investigate further to see whether this is really the case. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 8</ref> we vary Â¤ in computing the RMSRE and show the RMSRE for the three weightings considered, compared with the volume of traffic in the matrix elements above the threshold. The results show that no one scheme is a clear winner, but the square root scheme seems to win overall. We have investigated some other weighting schemes but have not found a superior one. The plot also provides another view into the performance of the algorithm, as the threshold used is varied. For instance, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 8</ref> also demonstrates that the results are better for the larger matrix elements (as the threshold increases the volume of the thresholded matrix elements decreases, and the performance improves). The RMSRE actually drops below 5% for the top 20% of traffic. This is a very desirable result, but we can also see that a very large proportion of the traffic (over 90%) has a RMSRE less than 20%. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows the distribution of errors for the generalized gravity model with square-root weighted least squares, and the particularly noteworthy point to take away from this plot is that more than 30% of the estimated matrix elements have a negligible error (less than 0.5%). The plot also shows the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution that lie within 3 23%. Furthermore, the plot shows that the results are not biased in one direction or the other. Thus, when we aggregate these results to higher levels, for instance PoP to PoP traffic matrices, the errors should not add to make things worse. We examine whether this is the case in the following figure. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the percentage of traffic (over the whole data set) for which the magnitude of the relative error below some value (for the generalized gravity model with square-root weighted least squares). Once again we see good results: more than 30% of the traffic has negligible relative error, and nearly 70% has an error less than 10% for the BR to BR traffic matrix. Further, as we have noted earlier, it is possible to derive PoP to PoP traffic matrices directly from the BR to BR traffic matrices. The dashed line in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the equivalent curve for such matrices, showing that the performance is actually slightly better over the majority of the distribution for the PoP to PoP matrices. In fact, the RMSE for the PoP to PoP matrix is 10 Mbps, while the RMSRE is 11%.</p><p>Another method to assess the quality of the results is to look at the prediction our estimated traffic matrix would make of properties of the network. A simple example is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> Finally, consider what happens to the estimates over time. We want to be able to answer questions about the variability of the traffic, or to detect trends or changes in the traffic matrix. It is therefore desirable for the results to remain stable -that is, for the errors in the estimated traffic matrix to remain approximately constant over time, even as the traffic matrix itself changes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> shows two comparisons of elements of the traffic matrix over time, with their predicted values (note the gaps are where our archive is missing data). The first shows a case where the error is very small. The two curves (the actual and estimated matrix elements) are almost indiscernible, even though we can see clear diurnal variation in the traffic, and a profound drop in the traffic at one point where the network topology changed dramatically. The estimates track the traffic matrix perfectly. The second plot shows the results for a case that is not so accurate, but once again we see that the estimated value follows the variation of the true flow smoothly. Thus even where there are errors in the traffic matrix, the results can still be used for a range of operational tasks such as detecting traffic changes.  </p></div>

Similar behavior is also evident in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>, where we vary the threshold Â¤ in computing the RM-SRE and show the RMSRE compared with the volume of traffic in the matrix elements above the threshold. While a more detailed study of robustness must thoroughly investigate the types of measurement errors seen in practice, these results show that the tomogravity method is robust to measurement errors on the observables.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have presented a simple, fast and practical method called tomogravity for computing router to router traffic matrices in large IP networks, based on widely available link measurements. The tomogravity method combines the best features of gravity models and tomographic techniques. The method scales to handle networks larger than any previously attempted using alternative methods, and it is very fast (taking less than 5 seconds for a large network). Furthermore, this router to router traffic matrix may be used to directly derive an even more accurate PoP to PoP traffic matrix.</p><p>We have validated the method on the a large commercial IP backbone network, where direct measurements of the traffic matrix were available for June 2002. The results show remarkable accuracy for the larger elements in the traffic matrix: the estimates typically fall within a few percent of true values. These larger values dominate network and traffic engineering applications. However, the accuracy over all the matrix elements is still reasonable, and Tomogravity is now being used for a variety of capacity planning and management tasks in this network.</p><p>There are several avenues for further improvements. In particular, we would like to be able to include additional constraints in the solution. For instance, if one has partial flow level data available, this could provide additional constraints. Another avenue of exploration is the use of alternative starting points such as that proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Â¢ into the network and egress point Â£ out of the network, the volume of traffic Â¤ Â¦ Â¥ Â¨ Â§Â© from Â¢ to Â£</figDesc></figure>

The x-axis shows the proportion of the network traffic falling above the threshold, and the y-axis shows the RMSRE for the varying threshold. The results show that the RMSRE is smaller for the larger matrix elements. The plot also provides another view into the performance of the algorithm, as the threshold used is varied. For instance, Figure 8 also demonstrates that the results are better for the larger matrix elements (as the threshold increases the volume of the thresholded matrix elements decreases, and the performance improves). The RMSRE actually drops below 5% for the top 20% of traffic. This is a very desirable result, but we can also see that a very large proportion of the traffic (over 90%) has a RMSRE less than 20%. Figure 1 shows the distribution of errors for the generalized gravity model with square-root weighted least squares, and the particularly noteworthy point to take away from this plot is that more than 30% of the estimated matrix elements have a negligible error (less than 0.5%).
