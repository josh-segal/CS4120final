				<p>It is known that, within the service time distribution class DHR, the FB discipline minimizes the mean delay in the M/G/1 queue among all work-conserving and non-anticipating service disciplines. It is also believed that a similar result is valid within a more general distribution class IMRL. However, we point out a flaw in the existing proof of this latter result that cannot be overcome. Moreover , by constructing a counterexample , we demonstrate that FB is not optimal within class IMRL. On the other hand, we prove that the mean delay for FB is smaller than that of PS within class IMRL giving a weaker version of an earlier hypothesis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Consider an M/G/1 queue with arrival rate λ, mean service time E <ref type="bibr">[S]</ref>, and load ρ = λE[S] &lt; 1. Jobs are served according to a work-conserving and non-anticipating service (scheduling) discipline π. Discipline π is work-conserving if it does not idle when there are jobs waiting and non-anticipating if the remaining service times of jobs are unknown for the server. Let Π denote the family of such service disciplines. For example, the well known disciplines FCFS and PS belong to this family, while SRPT (Shortest-Remaining-Processing-Time) does not.</p><p>Let F (x) = P {S ≤ x}, x ≥ 0, denote the cumulative service time distribution function of any job. We assume that F (x) &lt; 1 for all x. If the service time distribution has density f(x), the hazard rate h(x) is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h(x) = f(x) 񮽙 ∞ x f(y) dy .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>A service time distribution belongs to class DHR (Decreasing Hazard Rate) if h(x) is decreasing for all x, i.e., h(x) ≥ h(y) whenever x ≤ y. Yashkov <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> has shown that, within class DHR, the mean delay is minimized by the FB (Foreground-Background) discipline, which gives priority to the job with the least attained service. In fact, Righter and Shanthikumar <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have proved that FB minimizes, not only the mean delay and the mean queue length, but the queue length even in the stochastic sense. The FB discipline is also known as FBPS (Feedback Processor-Sharing), LAST (Least-Attained-Service-Time) and LAS (Least-AttainedService).</p><p>Let then F (x) denote the corresponding tail distribution function, F (x) = 1−F (x), and define</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H(x) = F (x) 񮽙 ∞ x F (y) dy .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A service time distribution belongs to class IMRL (Increasing Mean Residual Lifetime) if H(x) is decreasing for all x, i.e., H(x) ≥ H(y) whenever x ≤ y. This is due to the fact that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E[S − x | S &gt; x] = 񮽙 ∞ x F (y) dy F (x) = 1 H(x) .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Note that this conditional expectation is well defined since we assumed that F (x) &gt; 0 for all x. It is known that IMRL is a weaker condition than DHR. In other words, DHR ⊂ IMRL. Righter et al. <ref type="bibr">[8, Theorem 3.14]</ref> state that FB minimizes the mean delay even within class IMRL. (Unfortunately, there is a misprint in the abstract of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> stating just the opposite. The right form is given in <ref type="bibr">[8, Theorem 3.14]</ref>.) Still a more general class consists of those service time distributions for which C 2 [S] ≥ 1, where C 2 [S] refers to the squared cofficient of variation of the service time distribution, <ref type="bibr">Example 1]</ref> demonstrate, by constructing a counter-example, that FB is not optimal within this class. In particular, they evert the hypothesis by Coffman and Denning that the mean delay for FB would be smaller than that of PS (Processor-Sharing) whenever C 2 [S] &gt; 1. The distribution given in their counter-example, while having a greater squared cofficient of variation than 1, does not belong to class IMRL. (Unfortunately, there is also a misprint in [9, <ref type="bibr">Example 1]</ref>. The corrected version reads as follows: P {S = 1} = 4 5 + 񮽙 and P {S = 6} = 1 5 − 񮽙. Then C 2 [S] &gt; 1 for any 0 &lt; &lt; &lt; 1 10 .) In this paper, we prove that, contrary to <ref type="bibr">[8, Theorem 3.14]</ref>, FB does not minimize the mean delay within class IMRL. More specifically, we first identify a flaw in the proof of <ref type="bibr">[8, Theorem 3.14]</ref> that cannot be overcome. Then we choose a service time distribution that belongs to IMRL but not to DHR, and construct a discipline for which the mean delay is smaller than that of FB. On the other hand, we prove that the mean delay for FB is smaller than that of PS within class IMRL giving a weaker version of the hypothesis by Coffman and Denning.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C 2 [S] = D 2 [S]/E[S] 2 . Wierman et al. [9,</formula><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, in Section 2, we recall an essential point in the proof of <ref type="bibr">[8, Theorem 3.14]</ref>, which a relationship between the mean delay and so called truncated workload. Then, in Section 3, we consider the sample paths of the truncated workload process, and prove that FB is not pathwisely optimal, which contradicts with [8, <ref type="bibr">Lemma 3.5]</ref>. In Section 4, we prove that FB is neither optimal with respect to the mean truncated workload but still outperforms PS. In Section 5, we finally construct the counter-example demonstrating that FB does not minimize the mean delay within class IMRL, which contradicts with <ref type="bibr">[8, Theorem 3.14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Relationship between mean delay and truncated workload</head><p>In this section we recall a relationship between the mean delay and so called truncated workload, which the proof of <ref type="bibr">[8, Theorem 3.14]</ref> is based on. We define the truncated workload as the sum of remaining service times of those jobs in the system whose attained service is less than a given truncation threshold x. The relationship is given below in Proposition 1.</p><p>Let N π denote the mean number of jobs in the system and V π x the mean truncated workload with truncation threshold x. Righter et al. [8, <ref type="bibr">Lemma 3.12]</ref> show that, for any π ∈ Π,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">N π = 񮽙 ∞ 0 − H(x) dV π x ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where H(x) is as given in (2). In fact, Righter et al. define the truncated workload as the sum of remaining service times of those jobs in the system whose attained service is less than or equal to a given truncation threshold x. However, since H(x) is continuous from the right, formula (4) is valid also with our definition. Assume then that the function H(x) is monotonous so that the service time distribution belongs to either IMRL or DMRL. In this case the mean number of jobs in two systems with disciplines π, π 񮽙 ∈ Π, respectively, may be compared as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">N π − N π 񮽙 = − 񮽙 ∞ 0 (V π x − V π 񮽙 x ) dH(x).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>This equation follows from (4) after a partial integration, and can be found from the proof of <ref type="bibr">[</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">≤ V π 񮽙 x for all x, then T π ≤ T π 񮽙 .</formula><p>Righter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> use this result, which is valid an sich, to show that FB minimizes the mean delay within class IMRL. The problem lies in their Lemma 3.5, where they state that FB is optimal with respect to the truncated workload even in each sample path. Below in Proposition 3, we, however, show that this is not the case. Furthermore, in Proposition 4, we show that FB is neither optimal with respect to the mean truncated workload. Finally, in Theorem 1, we show that FB is not optimal with respect to the mean delay.</p><p>In all these cases, a better discipline is found from the family of MLPS disciplines, which were introduced by L. Kleinrock in the early 1970's <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. They have recently attracted attention in the context of the Internet as an appropriate flow-level model for the bandwidth sharing obtained when priority is given to short TCP connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>An MLPS discipline π is defined by a finite set of level thresholds a 1 &lt; · · · &lt; a N defining N + 1 levels, N ≥ 0. A job belongs to level n if its attained service is at least a n−1 but less than a n , where a 0 = 0 and a N +1 = ∞. Between these levels, a strict priority discipline is applied with the lowest level having the highest priority. Thus, those jobs with attained service less than a 1 are served first. Within each level n, an internal discipline D n is applied. The internal disciplines may vary in the set {FB, PS, FCFS}. We denote by MLPS the family of MLPS disciplines. All these disciplines belong to the family Π of work-conserving and non-anticipating disciplines.</p><p>In particular, we are interested in those MLPS disciplines π for which the internal discipline at the first level is FCFS. For any x &gt; 0, let FCFS x denote the subfamily of MLPS disciplines π such that a 1 = x and D 1 = FCFS. For example, the two-level discipline FCFS + FB(x) with level threshold x, which applies FCFS at the first level and FB at the second level, belongs to this subfamily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Sample path results for the truncated workload</head><p>In this section we show that FB is not pathwisely optimal with respect to the truncated workload, which contradicts with [8, <ref type="bibr">Lemma 3.5]</ref>.</p><p>Consider a single server queueing system starting empty at time t = 0 and obeying a service discipline π ∈ Π. We assume that jobs arrive one at a time. They are indexed with i = 1, 2, . . . according to their arrival order.</p><p>Let A i denote the arrival epoch of job i and S i its service time. In addition, let X π i (t) denote the attained service of job i at time t. Let then A(t) and N π (t) denote the set of jobs arrived and those in the system at time t, respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A(t) = {i : A i ≤ t}, N π (t) = {i ∈ A(t) : X π i (t) &lt; S i }.</formula><p>For any x &gt; 0, let N π x (t) denote the set of those jobs in the system whose attained service is less than x,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">N π x (t) = {i ∈ A(t) : X π i (t) &lt; min{x, S i }}. Denote further A(t) = |A(t)|, N π (t) = |N π (t)|, and N π x (t) = |N π x (t)|.</formula><p>For any x ≥ 0, let V π x (t) denote the remaining workload in the system at time t contributed by those jobs with attained service less than x,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">V π x (t) = 񮽙 i∈N π x (t) (S i − X π i (t)),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>which is briefly called the truncated workload with truncation threshold x. Note that in the limit x → ∞ the truncated workload equals the ordinary workload of this system, i.e., the sum of remaining service times of all jobs, which is the same for all workconserving disciplines.</p><p>To get another expression for the truncated workload V π x (t), let R π x (t) denote the total rate at which service is provided to the jobs with attained service less than x at time t. Whenever there are such jobs, the truncated workload is decreasing continuously with this rate. But it may also decrease discontinuously: whenever the attained service of a job reaches the truncation threshold x so that the job drops out from N π x (t), the truncated workload decreases by a step that equals the remaining service time of that job. Thus, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">V π x (t) = 񮽙 i∈A(t) S i − 񮽙 t 0 R π x (u) du − 񮽙 i∈A(t)\N π x (t) (S i − min{x, S i }).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>First we show that certain MLPS disciplines are not worse than FB with respect to the truncated workload.</p><p>Proposition 2 Let x &gt; 0 and π * ∈ FCFS x . Then, for any t ≥ 0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">V π * x (t) ≤ V FB x (t).</formula><p>Proof. Both the disciplines, π * and FB, give full priority for the jobs with attained service less than x. Thus, R π * x (t) = R FB x (t) for all t ≥ 0, and consequently</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">񮽙 t 0 R π * x (u) du = 񮽙 t 0 R FB x (u) du.</formula><p>It follows that the second term in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">(7)</ref> is the same for both disciplines. Let us then consider the third term in (7). Note first that, for any π ∈ Π, 񮽙</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">i∈A(t)\N π x (t) (S i − min{x, S i }) = 񮽙 i∈Ax(t)\N π x (t) (S i − min{x, S i }),</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">A x (t) = {i ∈ A(t) : S i &gt; x}.</formula><p>In the FB system the jobs with S i &gt; x reach the attained service level x in batches. In the corresponding π * system, where the discipline is FCFS below this level, the same jobs reach level x one-by-one in such a way that the job arrived last reaches this level not later than the whole batch in the FB system. This is due to the work-conserving principle. Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">A x (t) \ N FB x (t) ⊂ A x (t) \ N π * x (t), which implies that 񮽙 i∈Ax(t)\N FB x (t) (S i − min{x, S i }) ≤ 񮽙 i∈Ax(t)\N π * x (t) (S i − min{x, S i }).</formula><p>By combining these results with <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">(7)</ref>, we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">V π * x (t) = 񮽙 i∈A(t) S i − 񮽙 t 0 R π * x (u) du − 񮽙 i∈Ax (t)\N π * x (t) (S i − min{x, S i }) ≤ 񮽙 i∈A(t) S i − 񮽙 t 0 R FB x (u) du − 񮽙 i∈Ax(t)\N FB x (t) (S i − min{x, S i }) = V FB x (t)</formula><p>, which completes the proof.</p><p>2</p><p>Then we show that these disciplines are strictly better than FB.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Proposition 3 Let x &gt; 0 and π * ∈ FCFS x .</formula><p>There is a sample path and t ≥ 0 such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">V π * x (t) &lt; V FB x (t).</formula><p>Proof.

This is essentially due to the fact that Righter et al. confuse the truncated workload V π x (t) with the variable</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">U π x (t) defined by U π x (t) = 񮽙 i∈N π x (t) (min{S i , x} − X π i (t)),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>which we call unfinished truncated work with truncation threshold x. So the remaining truncated service times are summed up instead of the ordinary remaining service times as in (6). It is true that FB is pathwisely optimal with respect to the unfinished truncated work [1, Proposition 5] but, as Proposition 3 reveals, not with respect to the truncated workload. The confusion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> can be explained as follows. As given in [1, Equation (16)], we have Remark 2 Strictly speaking, if the truncated workload were defined as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, i.e., as the sum of remaining service times of those jobs in the system whose attained service is less than or equal to the given truncation threshold x, the disciplines π * and FB considered in the proof of Proposition 3 would have the same truncated workload for all t. However, in that case, a slightly modified discipline π * ∈ FCFS x+񮽙 with sufficiently small 񮽙 &gt; 0 would serve as a counter-example for [8, <ref type="bibr">Lemma 3.5]</ref>, which is easily verified.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">U π x (t) = 񮽙 i∈A(t) S i − 񮽙 t 0 R π x (u) du.<label>(9)</label></formula></div>

However, as shown above, their Lemma 3.5 is not valid. So it remains an open question whether (10) is valid or not.</p><p>In this section we show that (10) is neither valid. We start with some preliminary results related to a modified queue where the service times are replaced by their truncated versions in Section 4.1. In Section 4.2, we derive some fundamental formulas for the mean truncated workload. Then, in Section 4.3, we give the mean truncated workload formulas for FB, PS and FCFS x disciplines. Finally, in Section 4.4, we show that FB is not optimal with respect to the mean truncated workload but still outperforms PS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Mean delay results</head><p>In this section we justify our principal claim that FB does not minimize the mean delay within class IMRL, which contradicts with <ref type="bibr">[8, Theorem 3.14]</ref>. On the other hand, we</p><p>show that FB still outperforms PS with respect to the mean delay within class IMRL, which can be considered as a generalization of [9, Theorem 1].</p><p>Theorem 1 There is a service time distribution belonging to class IMRL and π ∈ Π such that T π &lt; T FB .</p><p>Proof. 1 • First we need a distribution that belongs to IMRL but not to DHR.

The corresponding density function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">f(x) = 񮽙 c −x ln c, 0 ≤ x ≤ c cx −c−1 , x &gt; c.<label>(25)</label></formula><p>The hazard rate is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">h(x) = 񮽙 ln c, 0 ≤ x ≤ c cx −1 , x &gt; c.<label>(26)</label></formula><p>It is easy to see that F (x) belongs to DHR if and only if h(c−) ≥ h(c+), which is equivalent to the requirement that c ≥ e. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> we have depicted the function h(x) for c = 2. The mean residual lifetime function is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">1 H(x) =        1 ln c + 񮽙 c c − 1 − 1 ln c 񮽙 c x−c , 0 ≤ x ≤ c x c − 1 , x &gt; c .<label>(27)</label></formula><p>Since, for all c &gt; 1,</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">c c − 1 − 1 ln c &gt; 0,</formula><p>we deduce from (27) that F (x) belongs to IMRL with any c &gt; 1. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref> we have depicted the function 1/H(x) for c = 2. All in all, F (x) belongs to IMRL but not to DHR if and only if 1 &lt; c &lt; e ≈ 2.71828.  2 • Use then the following heuristic to construct a discipline that might be better than FB: whenever the hazard rate is increasing, FCFS is optimal, and whenever it is decreasing, FB is optimal. So let us compare disciplines FB and FCFS + FB(c + 񮽙) with 񮽙 ≥ 0. The conditional mean delays read as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">T FB (x) = W x + x 1 − ρ x , x≥ 0,<label>(28)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">T FCFS+FB(c+񮽙) (x) =        W c+񮽙 + x, 0 ≤ x ≤ c + 񮽙 T FB (x), x&gt;c+ 񮽙.<label>(29)</label></formula><p>2.1 • First we consider the FCFS + FB(c) discipline with 񮽙 = 0 and show that</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">T FCFS+FB(c) = T FB .<label>(30)</label></formula><p>By <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(28)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(29)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">T FCFS+FB(c) − T FB = 񮽙 c 0 񮽙 T FCFS+FB(c) (x) − T FB (x) 񮽙 f(x)dx.</formula><p>Since, by <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(25)</ref> </p><p>it follows from (30) that there is δ &gt; 0 such that, for any 0 &lt; &lt; &lt; δ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">T FCFS+FB(c+񮽙) &lt; T FB<label>(32)</label></formula><p>revealing the non-optimality of FB for this distribution. <ref type="bibr">By (28)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(29)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">T FCFS+FB(c+񮽙) = 񮽙 c+񮽙 0 (W c+񮽙 + x)f(x) dx + 񮽙 ∞ c+񮽙 W x + x 1 − ρ x f(x) dx.</formula><p>Thus, by <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref>, we get the desired result as follows: So in all these cases FCFS + FB(c + 񮽙) is found to be better than FB.</p></div>
