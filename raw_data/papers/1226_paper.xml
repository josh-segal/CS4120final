				<p>We explore the notion of a pseudo-free group, first introduced by Hohenberger [Hoh03], and provide an alternative stronger definition. We show that if Z * n is a pseudo-free abelian group (as we conjecture), then Z * n also satisfies the Strong RSA Assumption [FO97,CS00,BP97]. Being a &quot;pseudo-free abelian group&quot; may be the strongest natural cryptographic assumption one can make about a group such as Z * n. More generally, we show that a pseudo-free group satisfies several standard cryptographic assumptions, such as the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms.</p>

In the RSA Assumption, the phrase "non-negligible probability" is interpreted to mean a non-negligible function of log(n).</p><p>Strong RSA Assumption: It is infeasible for a probabilistic polynomialtime adversary, given an integer n that is the product of two sufficiently large randomly chosen primes, and an element a chosen randomly from Z * n , to compute an x ∈ Z * n and an integer e &gt; 1 such that x e = a (mod n) with non-negligible probability.</p><p>Assuming that Z * n is pseudo-free takes this progression one step further: the adversary may choose whatever equation he wishes and try to solve it, as long as the equation is "nontrivial"-unsatisfiable in the free group, with appropriate care for some details. The pseudo-free assumption is that the adversary will succeed with at most negligible probability. The assumption of pseudo-freeness may be made for any arbitrary finite group, such as an elliptic curve group or even a nonabelian group.

Assuming that a finite group is pseudo-free thus appears to be quite a strong assumption.</p><p>Why formulate and study such a strong assumption? Doesn't this go against the traditional style of making only the minimal complexity-theoretic assumptions necessary for a cryptographic scheme or protocol? Perhaps, but we provide the following motivation and justifications.</p><p>• It seems quite plausible that Z * n (for n the product of two sufficiently large randomly chosen primes) is in fact pseudo-free.</p><p>• Making stronger assumptions may make proofs easier (this is especially useful for pedagogic purposes).</p><p>• It may turn out that the pseudo-freeness is not a "stronger" assumption after all-it may be implied by simpler assumptions, perhaps more standard ones.</p><p>• Reasoning in a free group can be quite simple and intuitive, so assuming pseudo-freeness allows one to capture "natural" security proofs in a plausible framework.

Section 4 studies some of the implications of assuming that a group is pseudo-free.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Mathematical Groups</head><p>We first restate the definition of a mathematical group. Definition 1. A group G = (S, •) consists of a set S of elements, and a binary operator • defined on S, such that:</p><p>Closure: For all elements x, y ∈ S, we have x • y ∈ S. Identity: There is an element 1 ∈ S such that for all elements x ∈ S,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x • 1 = 1 • x = x . Associativity: For all elements x, y, z ∈ S, x • (y • z) = (x • y) • z . Inverses: For every element x ∈ S, there is an element y ∈ S such that x • y = y • x = 1 .</formula><p>We use multiplicative notation: ab means a • b. The inverse of x is denoted x −1 . We let G also denote the set S. A group G is finite iff |S| is finite. A group G is abelian if • is commutative: for all x, y ∈ G, xy = yx. We use the usual exponent notation: a e is the word aaa . . . a of length e, and a −e is the corresponding inverse word a −1 a −1 . . . a −1 of length e.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Computational Groups</head><p>A mathematical group G has some representation <ref type="bibr">[G]</ref> when used in cryptography. We call such a representation <ref type="bibr">[G]</ref> a computational group implementing an underlying mathematical group. Many computational groups may implement the same mathematical group.</p><p>In a computational group <ref type="bibr">[G]</ref>, each element x ∈ G has one or more representations as a finite-length bit string <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref>. We often omit brackets, understanding that each element has such representation(s). When G is finite, it is convenient to assume that there is a common bit-length N such that any representation of any element of G requires exactly N bits.</p><p>A computational group provides efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms for all of the following operations: 2 Composition: Given (representations of) group elements x and y, compute (a representation of) x • y. Identity: Compute (a representation of) the identity element 1. Inverses: Given (a representation of) an element x, compute (a representation of) x −1 . Equality Testing: Given (representations of) any two elements x, y ∈ G, determine if x = y.</p><p>Sampling: (Only if G is finite.) Return (a representation of) an element chosen uniformly at random from G, or in a manner that is indistinguishable from uniformly at random to a probabilistic polynomialtime (PPT) adversary. We denote such a procedure as x ∈ R G.</p><p>As a running example: given n, the product of two large primes, anyone, including an adversary, can efficiently do all the group operations in Z * n , using the usual representation of elements as residues modulo n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Black Box Groups</head><p>The parties in a cryptographic protocol may access the group in a black-box manner, a notion introduced by <ref type="bibr">Babai and Szemerédi [BS84]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr">Babai [Bab97]</ref>, and see Boneh and Lipton <ref type="bibr">[BL96]</ref> for extension of the black-box notion to fields).</p><p>Under the black-box assumption, each element of the computational group is a bit string of some common length N , and "black-box" subroutines are available for the group operations. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The black-box assumption is that group operations may only be performed using the supplied implementations. Furthermore, the representation of group elements is "opaque": operations on them other than through the black-box routines are forbidden. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> It is natural to ask if there are black-box algorithms for various grouptheoretic problems. The black-box assumption is reasonable for algorithm design; it amounts to a convention or a self-imposed restriction on what operations may be performed. To find an efficient algorithm under the black-box assumption is then a satisfying result; no unusual "tricks" are required.</p><p>For example, Tonelli and Shanks [BS96, Section 7.1] [Coh93, Section 1.5.1] give a probabilistic black-box algorithm for computing square roots in Z * p ; it finds the black-box representation <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref> of a value x satisfying</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x 2 = a (mod p)</formula><p>given the black-box representation <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref> of a (assumed to be a quadratic residue), and also given the prime p. Other algorithms for this problem, such as Cipolla's [BS96, <ref type="bibr">Section 7.2]</ref>, violate the black-box assumption for Z * p by utilizing both field operations available in F p .</p><p>If no efficient black-box algorithm can be found for a problem, then the blackbox assumption may be too restrictive. For example, Shoup [Sho97] proves lower bounds for discrete logarithms and other problems in the black-box group model. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> For Babai <ref type="bibr">[Bab97]</ref>, these operations include all but sampling, as he studies the implementation of the sampling procedure itself. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In some applications side information such as the size or structure of the underlying group, such as the fact that the group is cyclic, is known, even though the group's representation is otherwise "black-box;" we don't consider such side information here.</p><p>However, we are studying here not algorithmic efficiency, but cryptographic security. A typical adversary may willfully violate any black-box assumption: he may examine the bits of any representation or examine the code implementing any group operation.</p><p>Consider our running example: Z * n . Here an adversary is given n, and code for composition (i.e., for multiplication modulo n). Nothing prevents him from examining this code or the bit-level representations of elements, or from using methods such as "index-calculus methods" [SS98] not allowed under a black-box assumption.</p><p>Therefore, we do not make black-box assumptions. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We assume that an adversary may use any available information and may use methods that depend upon representation or implementation details. The adversary has "non-blackbox" access to the group implementation. Whether a group is pseudo-free may then depend on the details of its representation as a computational group; one should properly speak of whether a computational group is pseudo-free or not. In any case, for our purposes it will be relevant that an equation is satisifiable in a mathematical group if and only if it is satisfiable in any computational group representing it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Free Groups</head><p>Free groups are infinite groups derivable from a given set of generators that have no non-trivial relationships.</p><p>Free groups are defined formally as follows. (See also Gutiérrez [Gut00], for example.) Let A = {a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a k } be a nonempty set of distinct symbols, which are the generators of a free group. For each such symbol a i , let a −1 i be a new symbol representing the inverse of a i . Let A −1 denote the set {a −1 i | a i ∈ A}, and let A ±1 denote A ∪ A −1 ; A ±1 is the set of symbols for the free group with set A of generators.</p><p>We let F (A) denote the free group defined by the set A of generators. We may equivalently write F (a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a k ) when A = {a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a k }. Elements of this free group may be represented as words (sequences of symbols of this free group). As an example, the word</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">a 1 a −1 2 a 2 a −1 1 a −1 3 a 2 represents an element of F (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 ).</formula><p>A word may be simplified, or reduced, by repeatedly eliminating any two adjacent inverse symbols; the resulting word is equivalent to the original. Thus, the word in the above example is equivalent to a −1 3 a 2 . A word that can not be reduced further is reduced or in canonical form.</p><p>The elements of a free group are thus words in canonical form. One could alternatively define the elements to be equivalence classes of words.</p><p>The operation • for a free group is concatentation followed by simplification.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">For example, a 1 a 2 • a −1 2 a 3 = a 1 a 2 a −1 2 a 3 = a 1 a 3 .</formula><p>The identity for a free group is the empty word . Two words represent the same element of a free group if their reduced forms are the same. The inverse of a word is just the reverse of the word, with each symbol replaced by its inverse. The operator • is closed and associative-for a proof see, for example, Lyndon and Schupp [LS77, <ref type="bibr">Chapter I]</ref>.</p><p>A free group on at least one generator is an infinite group, since there are an infinite number of distinct words in canonical form (e.g. {a k }).</p><p>Since a free group is infinite, it is not possible to even approximately implement uniform sampling. However, it is easy to construct a computational group that implements a free group on a countable set of generators except for the uniform sampling requirement.</p><p>We note that if A ⊆ B, then F (A) is a subgroup of F (B).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Free Abelian Groups</head><p>A free abelian group F A(a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a k ) is defined similarly to ordinary free groups, except that the group is abelian. Thus, for any pair of symbols a and b, we may replace the sequence ab by the sequence ba and preserve equivalence. Commutativity enables one to define the canonical form for a word in F A(a 1 , a 2 , ..., a l ) to be a word of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">a e1 1 a e2 2 . . . a e l l for some integers e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e l . It is well known that F A(a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a l ) is iso- morphic to the l-fold direct sum Z ⊕ Z ⊕ · · · ⊕ Z. We could represent an element a e1 1 a e2 2 . . . a e l k of F A(a 1 , a 2 , .</formula><p>. . , a l ) by the vector (e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e l ), and implement • with vector addition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Pseudo-Free Groups</head><p>A cryptographic scheme may utilize a particular mathematical group G; all parties have access to a computational group <ref type="bibr">[G]</ref> representing G.</p><p>Intuitively, a group is pseudo-free if it is indistinguishable from a free group. A free group has no surprising or anomalous identities; the only truths are those implied by the axioms of group theory.</p><p>Thus, informally, we say that a finite group G is pseudo-free if a probabilistic polynomial-time adversary can not efficiently produce an equation E and a solution to E in G where E has no solution in the "corresponding free group." Of course, we need to define what we mean by "corresponding free group."</p><p>Assuming that a finite group such as Z * n is pseudo-free is thus a complexitytheoretic assumption, similar to but stronger than the RSA Assumption or the Strong RSA Assumption.</p><p>This assumption turns out to be very strong, as it implies several standard cryptographic assumptions (at least for G = Z * n ). Nonetheless, it seems a plausible assumption in some cases, and it may be useful for new applications. In any case, we find its formulation and elaboration interesting.</p><p>For example, in a free group (abelian or not), there is no solution to</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x 2 = a (1)</formula><p>where x is a variable ranging over group elements, and a is a generator of the free group, since for any value of x the reduced form of x 2 has even length. However, the corresponding equation in Z * n ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x 2 = a (mod n) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>has a solution if a is a square in Z * n . A solution to such a corresponding equation "proves" that Z * n is different than the corresponding free group. The adversary may not claim that G is distinguishable from a free group merely because G is obviously finite, for example, because the elements of G all have N -bit representations. We insist on a different kind of proof: the adversary must provide a solution to an equation in G whose "corresponding equation" in a free group has no solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Equations in Free Groups</head><p>Let H denote a free group, such as F <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(a 1 , a 2</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">w 1 = w 2</formula><p>where w 1 and w 2 are words formed from the symbols of H and from the variables x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x m . One can always put such equations in a "canonical form" of the form w = 1 for some word w.</p><p>As an example, in F (a 1 , a 2 ) the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">a 1 x 1 = x 2 a −1 2 ,</formula><p>has many solutions (x 1 , x 2 ), such as (a −1 2 , a 1 ) or (1, a 1 a 2 ). Equations that have solutions in the free group are called satisfiable, others are called unsatisfiable.</p><p>Our definition of a pseudo-free group depends on being able to distinguish effectively between satisfiable and unsatisfiable equations in a free group.</p><p>Can one decide whether a given equation is satisfiable or not? Fortunately, one can. In 1982 Makanin <ref type="bibr">[Mak82]</ref> showed that it is decidable whether or not an equation in the free group is satisfiable. More recently Gutiérrez [Gut00] has shown that this problem is decidable in PSPACE. For our use, these results are quite sufficient; the decision procedure need not be in polynomial-time.</p><p>When the free group is the abelian group F A(a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a l ) it is easy to determine whether a given equation is satisfiable: the equation can always be rewritten in the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">x d1 1 x d2 2 · · · x dm m = a e1 1 a e2 2 · · · a e l l for integers d 1 , d 2 , . . . , d m , e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e l . Such an equation is satisfiable iff for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ l, we have gcd(d 1 , d 2 , . . . , d m ) | e i .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>One can prove that this statement holds for l = 1 and that such solutions can be combined for larger l. An equation that is satisfiable in F (A) is also satisfiable in F A(A) (but not necessarily conversely). This is useful since it provides an easy way to prove that an equation is unsatisfiable in a free group: merely prove that it is unsatisfiable in the corresponding free abelian group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Correspondence</head><p>Given an equation that is unsatisfiable in a free group F (A), what counts as a "corresponding equation" in a given group G?</p><p>We have to be a little careful, since there are trivial cases to avoid. For example, the previously mentioned quadratic equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">x 2 = a ,</formula><p>which is unsatisfiable in F (a), may have "trivial" solutions in Z * n , depending on how the element in Z * n corresponding to the generator a of the free group is selected. For example, if the adversary is allowed to specify that a = 4, then there is clearly the trivial solution x = 2.</p><p>We resolve this issue (following Hohenberger's thesis <ref type="bibr">[Hoh03]</ref>) by requiring that when making the correspondence between interpreting the equation in the free group and interpreting it in G, each of the generators a i must correspond to an independently generated random element of G.</p><p>The adversary thus has no control over the choice of elements in G that are to correspond to the generators in the free group.</p><p>Thus, for example, the adversary must take the square root of a randomly chosen element a ∈ Z * n in order to demonstrate an acceptable solution to the above equation, when G is the group Z * n . This requirement that generators in the free group correspond to randomly chosen elements of G fits naturally with common cryptographic usage where, for example, one party publishes randomly-chosen elements g and h such that finding the discrete logarithm of h base g is assumed to be hard. For the adversary, the randomly chosen elements g and h are the "generators" of the group he must attack.</p><p>Informally, an adversary succeeds in distinguishing G from a free group if he can produce: are used, then they are to be replaced by the inverses of the randomly chosen values.)</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">• An equation E</formula><p>• Values for the variables x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x m that satisfy the equation produced in G.</p><p>This definition allows the adversary to choose the equation himself, as long as the equation is unsatisfiable in the free group. This generalizes the situation for the Strong RSA assumption, where the adversary may choose the exponent e.</p><p>For efficiency in describing his equation, the adversary may use "exponential expressions," such as a((ax) 531 x 17 ), (see [Gut00, Section 2.2.1]), or even the mathematically equivalent but potentially more compact notation of algebraic straight-line programs, as proposed in Hohenberger <ref type="bibr">[Hoh03]</ref>.</p><p>The adversary need not produce a proof that the equation is unsatisfiable in a free group, since this can be verified directly using Makanin's or Gutiérrez's algorithm. (One could alternatively require the adversary to produce an equation whose unsatisfiability can be verified in polynomial time, or to produce a polynomial-size proof of unsatisfiability; we do not study such a restriction here, since the impact of assuming pseudo-freeness is to support the infeasibility for an adversary to solve the equation, not to support using the equation in a protocol.)</p><p>We make our definition more precise as follows.</p><p>Definition 2. A family G = {G k : k ≥ 0} of finite computational groups is pseudo-free if:</p><p>-All operations in G k can be performed in time polynomial in k. -For every probabilistic polynomial-time adversary A, for every polynomial p(·), if α 1 , α 2 , . . . , α p(k) are elements chosen uniformly and independently at random from G k , then the probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Pr[A(G k , α 1 , α 2 , . . . , α p(k) ) = (E, β 1 , β 2 , . . . , β m )]</formula><p>where A is given access to the routines implementing the group G k as well as the elements α 1 , α 2 , . . . , α p(k) , and where</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">E = E(x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x m ; a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a p(k) )</formula><p>is an equation over the free group F (a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a p(k) ) with variables</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x m such that E is unsatisfiable in F (a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a p(k) ) but E(β 1 , β 2 , . . . , β m ; α 1 , α 2 , . . . , α p(k) ) is true in G k , is a negligible function of k.</formula><p>This definition refers to a family of computational groups, but one may apply it to a family of mathematical groups with the understanding that the groups are implemented in some standard way as computational groups. One may also wish to specify whether the adversary has black-box access or non-black-box access to the group.</p><p>If the groups G k are abelian, then we may also say that G is pseudo-free abelian, although we prefer just saying that G is pseudo-free when, as in the case G = {Z * n }, the groups are obviously abelian.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Pseudo-Freeness Implies Many Other Cryptographic Assumptions</head><p>If G is pseudo-free, then several standard complexity-theoretic assumptions follow.

They show these problems are independent: for each pair of problems there is a group such that one problem is solvable (i.e. satisfiability of the relevant equation is decidable) while the other problem is unsolvable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Diffie-Hellman Assumption</head><p>Interestingly, the (computational) Diffie-Hellman problem seems not to fit within our formalism. It is a very interesting open problem whether the Diffie-Hellman assumption is implied by pseudo-freeness. The Computational Diffie-Hellman problem (CDH) is the following: given a value g, and two values</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">a = g e (9) b = g f ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>for large randomly chosen integers e and f , to compute</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">x = g ef . (11)</formula><p>The CDH assumption is that an adversary will have a negligible chance of computing x, given a and b. The natural way of trying to show that the CDH assumption is implied by pseudo-freeness is via equations <ref type="formula">(9)</ref>- <ref type="formula">(11)</ref>, where e and f are integer-valued variables, and x is a group element variable (see section 5). However, this argument fails because an adversary who violates CDH to compute x need not be able to find e and f (this is DLP). There doesn't seem to be any equation in variable x alone (i.e., without e, f ) available to verify that an adversary has correctly computed x. In other words, the decisional DiffieHellman problem doesn't seem to be solvable by verifying an appropriate set of equations involving the single unknown x.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Generalizations</head><p>In this section we discuss some variations and generalizations on the basic notion of pseudo-freeness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Multiple Equations</head><p>Mal'cev <ref type="bibr">[Mal60]</ref> (see also [KM, Lemma 3 and Corollaries 2-3]) shows that for any finite set of equations in the free group, one can construct a single equation having exactly the same set of solutions. Thus, we may consider sets of simultaneous equations as equivalent to a single equation. The method is based on showing that the two equations x = 1, y = 1 are equivalent to the single equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">x 2 ax 2 a −1 = (ybyb −1 ) 2 .</formula><p>For abelian groups, it is easy to determine if a set of equations is satisfiable; one may apply standard techniques for solving a set of simultaneous equations over the integers (see Artin [Art91, <ref type="bibr">Section 12.4]</ref>, for example).</p><p>These results allow us to permit the adversary to produce a set of simultaneous equations rather than just a single equation, without loss of generality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Adversary Must Prove That Equation Is Unsatisfiable in the Free Group</head><p>One could require that the adversary provide a polynomial-time checkable proof that the equation he produces is indeed unsatisfiable in the corresponding free group. However, this restriction seems somewhat pointless, since the reason for assuming pseudo-freeness anyway is to conclude that finding an equation together with its solution should be infeasible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Generation of α's</head><p>Instead of providing random α's to the adversary directly, one could allow the adversary to produce them himself, as long as they are guaranteed to be "random" in some way. For example, the adversary might be allowed to use a hash function with range G to derive the relevant α. If the hash function is pseudorandom, or can be modeled as a random oracle <ref type="bibr">[BR93]</ref>, then its output could be considered as an acceptable α for purposes.</p><p>Similarly, if the output of h is an integer, then we may be able to accept g h(x) as an acceptable element α from G for our purposes. The essential criterion for sampling is that the adversary should have no control over the element chosen, and it should be reasonable to model the element chosen as being independently chosen (approximately) uniformly at random from G.</p><p>The values α supplied might also be constrained to ensure that a solution in G exists; we don't pursue this variant further here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Generalized Exponential Expressions</head><p>In the most general form of exponential expressions, the exponents may themselves be integer-valued variables. Consider for example, the equation (ax) e b = x f in F (a, b) where x is a variable ranging over group elements and e, f are integer-valued variables. This equation is satisifiable, for example, with x = b, e = 0, f = 1. It is an open problem how to decide if such equations, containing both element-valued variables and integer-valued exponent variables, are satisfiable-see Problem 3 in Section 7.</p><p>We may nonetheless allow an adversary to use these general exponential expressions, with variable exponents, because it is still possible to verify that the adversary has "done the impossible." The adversary produces an equation E with variable exponents, and also a solution that satisfies E. If E is unsatisfiable, then so is the equation E obtained by substituting into E the exponent values supplied in the adversary's solution. One can then verify that E is unsatisfiable using Makanin's algorithm.</p><p>Hohenberger uses straight-line programs in her definition of "equation" or "identity", a natural further generalization of the exponential expressions, which could also be allowed here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Adaptive Attacks and Side Information</head><p>It may be possible generalize the definition of pseudo-freeness here to handle adaptive attacks and other forms of "side information." How might the definition of pseudo-freeness change if side information, such as the order of the group, is known? Is there a reasonable way to do this? Similarly, how can the notion of pseudo-freeness be adapted to handle adaptive attacks, where the adversary may obtain a solution to an equation before having to provide a different solution (perhaps with new generators)?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>We compare our definition of a pseudo-free group with that given in Hohenberger's thesis. Her work is motivated by transitive signature schemes, and does introduce the critical correspondence between elements drawn from G at random and generators in the free group.</p><p>However, Hohenberger doesn't use variables, which are necessary for setting up equations and showing how pseudo-freeness implies other cryptographic assumptions, and she doesn't address the decidability of determining which equations are satisfiable in a free group. Also, her definition requires that an adversary have only "black-box" access to G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions and Open Problems</head><p>We have taken the definition of pseudo-free group introduced by Hohenberger <ref type="bibr">[Hoh03]</ref>, strengthened it, and shown how it implies a number of other wellknown cryptographic assumptions. While stronger than many previous cryptographic number-theoretic assumptions, pseudo-freeness seems fairly natural, worthy of study in its own right, and quite plausible for commonly used groups.</p><p>The study of pseudo-freeness yields some intriguing open problems and conjectures. We begin with our main conjecture. The next open problem is to relate the Diffie-Hellman assumption to pseudofreeness.</p><p>Conjecture 2 (Diffie-Hellman holds for Pseudo-free groups). In a pseudo-free group, both the computational and decisional Diffie-Hellman assumptions hold.</p><p>The following interesting problem, discussed briefly earlier, also appears to be open.</p><p>Conjecture 3. It is decidable whether a given equation (or set of equations) with constants is satisfiable over a free group, when the equation is written in exponential notation and may have integer-valued variables in the exponents.</p><p>Here is a (satisfiable) example of such an equation: a((ab) e y) f b = x 2 where x and y are variables (over the group), a and b are constants (group elements), and e and f are integer-valued variables. Some partial results are known <ref type="bibr">[Lyn60, LI71,CE84]</ref>; the introduction to <ref type="bibr">[CE84]</ref> gives a brief survey. This problem may also be open over semigroups.</p><p>Another open research direction is to explore ways of showing that a group G is not a free group, other than by demonstrating the solution to an equation that has no solution in a free group. For example, some statement of the elementary theory of free groups may be (say) false, but provably true in G. <ref type="bibr">Kharlampovich and Myasnikov [KM98]</ref> have shown that the elementary theory of a free group is decidable, even if constants are allowed, a much more general result than determining whether a given equation is satisfiable in the free group.</p><p>The theory of pseudo-free groups might also be expanded to handle cases such as Z * p ; this group is typically not pseudo-free, since the size of the group is presumably known in a typical implementation.</p><p>Finally, we note that we have only scratched the surface of the study of adaptive attacks against cryptographic schemes defined on pseudo-free groups; much work remains to be done here.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Lipschutz and Miller [LI71] consider six fundamental problems: the order problem [solving a e = 1 for e], the power problem (aka the discrete logarithm problem) [solving a e = b for e], the root problem (aka the RSA problem) [solving x e = a for x], the proper power problem (aka the strong RSA problem) [solving x e = a for x and e &gt; 1], the generalized power problem [solving a e = b f for nonzero e, f ], and the intersection problem for cyclic subgroups [solving a e = b f = 1 for e, f ].</figDesc></figure>
