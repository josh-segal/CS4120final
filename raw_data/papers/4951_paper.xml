In the most commonly used power-attenuation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the signal power falls as ½ Ö 񮽙 where Ö is the distance from the transmitter antenna and 񮽙 is a coefficient dependent on the wireless environment, typically between ¾ and 񮽙. Under this model the power requirement for supporting a link from node Ù to node Ú separated by a distance Ö is given by Ô´ÙÙ Úµ µ 񮽙 Ù 񮽙 Ú Ö 񮽙 ÙÚ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where 񮽙 Ù 񮽙 ¼ is the transmission efficiency of node Ù, 񮽙 Ú 񮽙 ¼ is the signal detection sensitivity threshold of node Ú, and 񮽙 ÙÚ is the signal attenuation exponent for the link from Ù to Ú. Typically it is assumed that all nodes have the same transmission efficiency and detection sensitivity coefficients, both normalized to 1, and that signal attenuation exponents 񮽙 ÙÚ have a common value 񮽙 (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>).

This motivates the study of the MIN-POWER SYMMET-RIC CONNECTIVITY problem, where a link is established only if both nodes have transmission range at least as big as the distance between them, and the goal is to ensure that the network is connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Formally Implicit in the work of Clementi, Penna, and Silvestri <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is a proof that MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIVITY in 񮽙 ¾ is NP-Hard.

In this paper we make the following contributions:</p><p>¯ We give an exact branch and cut algorithm based on a new integer linear program formulation for the problem (Section I).

Experimental results show an average of 5-6% reduction in power consumption compared to the simple MST based solution (Section III). For the important special case of nodes located on a line and monotonic symmetric power requirements, MIN-POWER SYM-METRIC CONNECTIVITY can be solved in polynomial time by dynamic programming; we omit the details for space reasons.</p></div>

C˘ alinescu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> push the approximation ratio below 2 by exploiting similarities between MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIVITY and the classic STEINER TREE problem.

Four problems have been studied under this model.</p><p>1. ASYMMETRIC UNICAST, which requires establishing a minimum power directed path from a source × to a destination Ø. ASYMMETRIC UNICAST is easily solved in polynomial time by shortest-path algorithms. The related MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC UNICAST problem can also be solved efficiently by a shortest-path computation in an appropriately constructed graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>2.

The best known approximation algorithm for ASYMMETRIC BROADCAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, based on computing a minimum spanning tree, has performance ratio of at most 12 when the nodes are in 񮽙 ¾ . Chu and Nikolaidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> give an experimental study of asymmetric broadcast algorithms for mobile ad hoc networks. As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the related SYMMETRIC BROADCAST problem is identical to MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIVITY.</p><p>3. ASYMMETRIC MULTICAST, in which one is given a root × and a set of terminals Ì , and the goal is to establish a minimumpower branching rooted at × which reaches all vertices of Ì . As a generalization of ASYMMETRIC BROADCAST, ASYMMET-RIC MULTICAST is also NP-Hard, and based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, it is immediate that a minimum Steiner tree would give an approximation ratio of ½¾񮽙, where 񮽙 is the approximation for Steiner tree in graphs (the best result known at this moment, given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, is 񮽙 ½ · ½ ¾ ÐÒ ¿ · 񮽙). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAM FORMULATION</head><p>In this section we give an integer linear program (ILP) formulation for MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIVITY and describe a branch and cut algorithm based on it. The results in Section III show that the algorithm is practical for instances with up to 35-40 nodes.</p><p>We To solve the ILP we use branch and cut, i.e., we drop the integrality constraints and solve the corresponding LP relaxation. If the solution of the LP is integral, we found the optimal solution, otherwise we pick a variable with a fractional value and split the problem into two subproblems by setting the variable to ¼ and ½ in the subproblems. We solve the subproblems recursively and disregard a subproblem if its LP bound is worse than the best known solution.</p><p>Since there are an exponential number of inequalities in this formulation of spanning trees, we can not solve the LP directly. Instead, we start with a small subset of these inequalities and algorithmically test whether the LP solution violates an inequality which is not in the current LP. If so, we add the inequality to the LP, otherwise we found the solution of the LP with the exponential number of inequalities. The inequalities added to the LP if needed are called cutting planes, algorithms that find violated cutting planes are called separation algorithms.</p><p>In our case, the initial LP consists of the constraints (3) and <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> for these inequalities is due to Padberg and Wolsey <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The running time of a branch and cut algorithm can improved by tightening the LP relaxation, i.e., by finding additional inequalities which are valid for all integer points, but may be violated by solutions to the LP relaxation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1 shows</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Improved Approximations for Symmetric Requirements</head><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed an algorithm with approximation ratio of 񮽙񮽙񮽙 · ¯ based on polynomial time approximation scheme for computing the minimum-weight spanning cactus in a 3-uniform hypergraph, and a more practical greedy algorithm with approximation ratio of 15/8. Below we improve the approximation factors of these two algorithms to 񮽙񮽙¿ · ¯ and 11/6, respectively. The greedy algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) iteratively improves the MST by inserting the best fork, i.e. The proof of the approximation ratios in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is based on on the notion of 3-restricted decomposition of a tree Ì , which is a partition of the edges of Ì into forks and individual edges. The power-cost of a 3-restricted decomposition É, Ô´Éµ, is the sum of power-costs of its elements, i.e., forks and individual edges. It is proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> that, if there exists a 3-restricted decomposition É with È ´Éµ 񮽙 񮽙Ô´Ì µ, then the greedy algorithm in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> has approximation ratio ½ · 񮽙񮽙¾ and there is PTAS with approximation ratio 񮽙 · ¯.

First we partition the edges of Ì into disjoint components using structural information derived from power requirements. Then we construct a weighted subgraph of the line graph of each component, which we refer to as the "consecutive" line graph. Finally, we show that the consecutive line graph of each component has a matching exceeding a certain weight; the edges in these matchings correspond to the forks in the desired 3-restricted decomposition of Ì .</p><p>To describe how we partition the edges of Ì (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>(a)) we need to introduce some additional notations. Let ÑÑÜ´Ùµ be the maximum edge of Ì incident to a vertex Ù. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>  where the last inequality comes from (7) and the fact that 񮽙´Ì µ 񮽙 Ô´Ì µ (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>).</p><p>By Edmonds' theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> it is sufficient to construct a fractional matching 񮽙 񮽙 satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. A fractional matching of Ä 񮽙 is an assignment of nonnegative fractions Ü´񮽙 ½ 񮽙 񮽙 ¾ µ to every edgé񮽙 ½ 񮽙 񮽙 ¾ µ ¾ Ä 񮽙 such that (i) the sum of fractions assigned to the edges incident to a vertex 񮽙 of Ä 񮽙 is at most 1, and (ii) the sum of fractions assigned to all edges with both endpoints in a set of ¾񮽙 · ½ vertices of Ä 񮽙 is at most 񮽙. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Hardness of Approximation for Asymmetric Requirements</head><p>The following theorem shows that handling asymmetric power requirements is intrinsically more difficult than handling symmetric requirements, e.g., under asymmetric power requirements the minimum total power cannot be approximated within any constant.</p><p>Theorem 2: MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIVITY WITH ASYMMETRIC POWER REQUIREMENTS cannot be approximated in polynomial time within factor´½factor´½ ¯µ Ð Ò 񮽙 Î 񮽙 for any ¯ ¯ ¼ unles È 񮽙 AE È .</p><p>Proof: We will prove the theorem by reduction from the set cover problem which is known to be non-approximable within factor´½factor´½ ¯µ Ð Ò 񮽙 Î 񮽙 for any ¯ ¯ ¼ unles È 񮽙 AE È <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>For any instance of the set cover problem, we construct an instance of the problem of MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNEC-TIVITY WITH ASYMMETRIC POWER REQUIREMENTS such that approximating the second problem within a factor 񮽙 implies approximating the first problem within the same factor.

EXPERIMENTAL STUDY We have implemented the exact branch and cut algorithm described in Section I (OPT), the greedy fork-contraction algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> (GFC), and three new heuristics: ¯ A simple edge-switching (ES) heuristic that starts from the MST, and repeatedly replaces a tree edge with a non-tree edge re-establishing connectivity. At every step, the algorithm chooses the pair of edges that results in the largest reduction in power cost; the process is repeated as long as improvement is still possible. We simulated a distributed implementation of the algorithm in which only non-tree edges that connect nodes within 10 tree-hops from each other are considered for switching.</p><p>¯ A heuristic performing both edge and fork switching (EFS). At every step the algorithm chooses the edge or the fork whose addition to the tree leads to the largest reduction in power cost. Unlike GFC, forks are not contracted, which means that an edge in an added fork can later be removed from the tree by other edge or fork switches. ¯ A Kruskal-like heuristic (KR) that starts with isolated nodes and iteratively adds an edge connecting two different components with minimum increase in power cost. A similar heuristic (called incremental search) was studied by Chu and Nikolaidis for computing low-power ASYM-METRIC BROADCAST trees in a mobile environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We included in our comparison faster versions of OPT and GFC, OPT-D and GFC-D, which speed-up the computation by working on the Delaunay graph defined by the nodes instead of the complete graph. We also implemented a faster version of EFS, EFS-D, in which only forks consisting of Delaunay edges (but still all non-tree edges) are considered as switching candidates.</p><p>All algorithms were implemented in C++, including the branch and bound algorithm whose implementation is built on SCIL <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The heuristics were compiled using gpp with -O2 optimization, and run on an AMD Duron 600MHz PC. The experiments were run on randomly generated testcases. For each instance size Ò between 10 and 100, in increments of 5, 50 different instances were generated by chosing Ò points uniformly at random from a grid of size ½¼񮽙 ¼¼¼ ¢ ½¼񮽙 ¼¼¼.</p><p>In   rithms. Running times are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table II</ref>. The results show that OPT has practical running time up to 35 nodes, and produces an average improvement over MST of 5-6%. The Delaunay version of OPT has practical runtime up to 60 nodes, but gives slightly worse solutions.</p><p>The provably good GFC algorithm, its faster Delaunay version, GFC-D, as well as the natural Kruskal-like heuristic KR are all very fast, but give less than half of the optimum improvement. In contrast, EFS, EFS-D, and even the distributed ES heuristic, come on the average within a fraction of a percent of the optimal improvement with very well scaling runtime.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.

CONNECTIVITY in graph theoretical terms. Let 񮽙 񮽙´Î񮽙´񮽙´Î Î µ 

be an edge-weighted graph and ÙÚ denote the undirected edge 

between nodes Ù and Ú. The cost 񮽙´ÙÚµ of an edge ÙÚ ¾ 񮽙 

corresponds to the (symmetric) power requirement Ô´ÙÙ Úµ 񮽙 

Ô´ÚÚÙµ. For a node Ù ¾ Î and a spanning tree Ì of 񮽙, let ÙÙ Ì 
be the maximum cost edge incident to Ù in Ì , i.e., ÙÙ Ì ¾ Ì and 

񮽙´ÙÙ Ì µ 񮽙 񮽙´ÙÚµ for all ÙÚ ¾ Ì . The power cost of a spanning 

tree Ì is

Since any connected graph contains a spanning tree, an equiv-
alent formulation of MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIV-
ITY is to ask for a spanning tree with minimum power-cost in 

the complete graph on Î with edge costs given by 񮽙´ÙÚµ 񮽙 

񮽙ÙÚ񮽙 񮽙 . Thus, MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIVITY can 

be reformulated as follows: 

MINIMUM POWER-COST SPANNING TREE: Given a con-

nected edge-weighted graph 񮽙 񮽙´ÎÎ񮽙´ÎÎ µ , find a spanning 

tree Ì of 񮽙 with minimum power-cost. 

To formulate MINIMUM POWER-COST SPANNING TREE as 
a linear integer program we use two types of binary decision 
variables: 

Ü ÙÚ for all ÙÚ ¾ 񮽙; Ü ÙÚ is set to 1 if ÙÚ belongs to the 

selected spanning tree Ì and to 0 otherwise. We call 
these variables the tree variables. 

Ý ÙÚ for all ÙÚ ¾ 񮽙 񮽙񮽙 񮽙ÙÚ ÚÙ񮽙ÙÚ ¾ 񮽙񮽙; Ý ÙÚ is set to 1 
if Ù Ì 񮽙 Ú (i.e., if ÙÚ ¾ Ì and 񮽙´ÙÚµ 񮽙 񮽙´ÙÛµ for all 

ÙÛ ¾ Ì . We call these variables the range variables.

is at least one edge in the spanning tree Ì crossing the cut Ë. 

Let ÙÚ be such an edge and Ù ¾ Ë. Then 񮽙´ÙÚµ 񮽙 񮽙´ÙÙ Ë µ and

Since we do not have a separation algorithm for these in-
equalities, we use the following heuristic to separate some of 

them. We chose an arbitrary node Ù. For every node Ú ¾ 
Î Ò Ò Ù 񮽙 , we compute the minimal directed cut from Ù to Ú 

and from Ú to Ù, where the capacity of an edge ÜÝ is given by

For each component 񮽙 ¾ ¾ , the consecutive line graph Ä 񮽙 is defined as follows (see Figure 3(b)): -vertices of Ä 񮽙 are the edges of 񮽙 -Ä 񮽙 has "consecutive" edges connecting each consecutive forks of 񮽙, and at most two "parity" edges connecting</head><label></label><figDesc>For each vertex Ù, we direct the edge ÑÑÜ´Ùµ away from Ù. An edge ÙÚ is called root if it is directed both ways (i.e., ÑÑÜ´Ùµ 񮽙 ÑÑÜ´Úµ µ ÙÚ), and called bridge if it remains undirected (i.e., ÑÑÜ´Ùµ 񮽙 񮽙 ÙÚ and ÑÑÜ´Úµ 񮽙 񮽙 ÙÚ). In the power-cost of Ì , roots are counted twice (for both endpoints), bridges are not counted at all, and all other edges are counted exactly once. Thus, denoting by Ê the set of roots and by 񮽙 the set of bridges, we have: Ô´Ì µ µ 񮽙´Ì񮽙´񮽙´Ì µ · 񮽙´Ê񮽙´񮽙´Ê µ 񮽙´񮽙񮽙´񮽙´񮽙 µ (7) The edges of Ì are partitioned as follows.

Then we add each bridge 񮽙 of 񮽙 to one of the two adjacent components of Ì 񮽙, such that each component gets at most one bridge. A bridge assignment with this property is obtained by selecting an arbitrary vertex Ú ¼ and assigning to each component of Ì 񮽙 not containing Ú ¼ the unique adjacent bridge on the path to Ú ¼ .

񮽙. Therefore, each matching 񮽙 of Ä 񮽙 corresponds to a 3-

This fractional matching satisfies (i) since each 񮽙 ¾ 񮽙 is incident to at most 3 consecutive edges of Ä 񮽙 (if 񮽙 is not the root Ö 񮽙 , then it participates into one consecutive edge of Ä 񮽙 as 񮽙 ½ , and into up to two edges as 񮽙 ¾ ; the root participates as the heaviest end in up to two edges). Condition (ii) follows from the fact that consecutive edges form a tree. Since every vertex 񮽙 of Ä 񮽙 except the root participates in exactly one consecutive fork´񮽙fork´񮽙 ½ 񮽙 񮽙 ¾ µ as 񮽙 ½ , we get that the weight of 񮽙 ¼ 񮽙 is equal tó񮽙´񮽙µ 񮽙´Ö 񮽙 µµ񮽙¿. If 񮽙 has no bridge then (8) follows. Otherwise we modify 񮽙 񮽙 such that the weight increases by 񮽙´񮽙 񮽙 µ񮽙¿ as follows. Let È 񮽙´񮽙񮽙´񮽙´񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 ¼ 񮽙 񮽙 ¼ 񮽙 񮽙 ½ 񮽙 񮽙 ½ 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 ·½ 񮽙 Ö 񮽙 µ be the unique path of consecutive edges of Ä 񮽙 , where 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙´񮽙񮽙´񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 ·½ µ, 񮽙 񮽙 ½ are edges of Ä 񮽙 corresponding to consecutive forks in 񮽙.

Since both 񮽙 񮽙 and Ö 񮽙 participate in at most two consecutive forks, the above change leads to a feasible fractional matching (the sum of fractions assignedLet Ú be the common vertex of 񮽙 񮽙 and Ö 񮽙 .

Since 񮽙 and 񮽙 񮽙 form a consecutive fork, Ä 񮽙 contains thé 񮽙 µ. Re- call that Ä 񮽙 also contains a parity edgé Ö 񮽙 µ. We modify 񮽙 񮽙</head><label>weight</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>to

If 񮽙 is odd we add back 1/3 to Ü´񮽙 񮽙 µ to guarantee increasing 
of Û´񮽙 񮽙 µ by at least 񮽙´񮽙 񮽙 µ񮽙¿. If 񮽙 񮽙 has degree 2 in Ä 񮽙 then 

we are done, since the sum of all fractions assigned to the edges 
incident to 񮽙 񮽙 equals to 1. Otherwise, 񮽙 񮽙 has degree 3 and we 
need to further modify 񮽙 񮽙 in order to make it a feasible frac-
tional matching. as follows: 

¯ If 񮽙 񮽙 ½ 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 (i.e., 񮽙 񮽙 ½ is not adjacent to the root), then we 
substract 1/3 from Ü´񮽙Ü´񮽙 µ and set Ü´ÖÜ´Ö 񮽙 µ to 1/3. 
¯ If 񮽙 񮽙 ½ 񮽙 񮽙 (i.e., 񮽙 񮽙 ½ is adjacent to the root), then we 
substract 1/3 from Ü´񮽙 񮽙 ½ µ and set Ü´񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙 ½ 񮽙 Ö 񮽙 µ to 

1/3. 
In both cases, the resulting sums of fractions assigned to the 
edges incident each of 񮽙 񮽙 and Ö 񮽙 are equal to 1, and hence 񮽙 񮽙 
satisfies (i). Condition (ii) is valid since edges with non-zero 
weight in 񮽙 񮽙 continue to form a tree.
