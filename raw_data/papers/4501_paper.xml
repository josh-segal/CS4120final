				<p>We present optimal schemes for allocating bits of fine-grained scalable video sequences among multiple senders streaming to a single receiver. This allocation problem is critical in optimizing the perceived quality in peer-to-peer and distributed multi-server streaming environments. Senders in such environments are heterogeneous in their outgoing bandwidth and they hold different portions of the video stream. We formulate the allocation problem as an optimization problem, which is nonlinear in general. We use rate-distortion models in the formulation to achieve the minimum distortion in the rendered video, constrained by the outgoing bandwidth of senders, availability of video data at senders, and incoming bandwidth of receiver. We show how the adopted rate-distortion models transform the nonlinear problem to an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. We then design a simple rounding scheme that transforms the ILP problem to a linear programming (LP) one, which can be solved efficiently using common optimization techniques such as the Simplex method. We prove that our rounding scheme always produces a feasible solution, and the solution is within a negligible margin from the optimal solution. We also propose a new algorithm (FGSAssign) for the allocation problem that runs in O(n log n) steps, where n is the number of senders. We prove that FGSAssign is optimal. Because of its short running time, FGSAssign can be used in real time during the streaming session. Our experimental study validates our analytical analysis and shows the effectiveness of our allocation algorithm in improving the video quality.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Video streaming over the Internet is increasingly getting very popular. In this paper, we consider video streaming systems in which a streaming session has multiple senders and a single receiver. Multiple senders may be required in peer-to-peer streaming environments, 1-3 because of the limited capacity and unreliability of peers. Multiple senders are also desired in distributed streaming systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> to achieve disjoint network path streaming and hence better quality. We consider the general case when senders have heterogeneous outgoing bandwidth, and may store different portions of the requested stream. Our problem is to optimally allocate to each potential sender a transmission rate and range of bits to transmit such that the best video quality is achieved at the receiver. We illustrate the importance of the bit allocation problem using the simple example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. There are three senders P1, P2, and P3, and one receiver P0. P1, P2, and P3 have outgoing bandwidth <ref type="bibr">of 192, 128, and 192 Kbps, respectively</ref>, and P0 has incoming bandwidth of 1 Mbps. Furthermore, senders are assumed to have downloaded different portions of the stream in the past.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a), a nonscalable allocation scheme is considered, which assumes that the video stream is encoded using a nonscalable encoder. In nonscalable encoding, the stream has to be downloaded in its entirety, otherwise it is not decodable. In this case, senders are considered to have different versions of the same stream. Therefore, under the nonscalable allocation scheme, the receiver can only get the 128 Kbps stream version. Notice that collaboration among senders is not possible, because the versions they have are encoded differently. Nonscalable encoding is actually not uncommon in current Internet streaming systems: Many streaming servers post the same video clip in different rates to accommodate users with heterogeneous bandwidth. To cope with the inflexibility of nonscalable encoding, some streaming systems encode a stream into multiple layers. Typically, there are a few number of layers, because of the layering overhead and the complexity of the coding/decoding processes. In layered scalable coding, partial layers are not decodable. 1(b) shows a layered scalable allocation scheme, where the stream is encoded into four layers, each has a bit rate of 128 Kbps. In this case, the receiver can get up to three layers, one from each sender. Thus the received stream will be of rate 384 Kbps. Due to the coarse-grain nature of the layers, this allocation scheme cannot leverage the remaining 64 Kbps bandwidth at each of P1 and P3.</p><p>The fine-granularity scalability (FGS) encoding adds significant flexibility to the layered encoding: FGS-encoded streams provide bit-level scalability, which means that bit streams can be truncated at any bit location. In addition, FGSencoded streams have the property that a low-quality stream is always a prefix of a higher-quality one. The FGS flexibility, however, complicates the problem of allocating bits to senders, because of the finer resolution and the too many allocation possibilities that should be considered to select the optimal allocation. For instance, a possible FGS allocation is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(c)</ref>, where the received stream has a bit rate of 384 Kbps. This scheme started by allocating the first 192 Kbps of the stream to P3. Thus it cannot use P2, because the stream at P2 is a prefix of what would be transmitted by P3. The only option left for this allocation scheme is to allocate the second 192 Kbps of the stream to P1. A more careful-actually optimal-allocation is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(d)</ref>, where the receiver gets a much better quality stream of 512 Kbps bit rate.</p><p>To summarize, this example indicates that significant quality improvement could be achieved by adopting the finegrained scalable encoding in streaming systems with multiple heterogeneous senders. It also highlights the importance of the optimal allocation of bits among senders.</p><p>The bit allocation problem described above can be solved on a frame-by-frame basis: For every frame, we optimally allocate the bits of that frame to senders. The optimal allocation ensures that the maximum number of bits in every frame is transmitted from senders. More bits of the same frame yield less reconstruction distortion, and hence better playout quality. The bit allocation problem could also be solved for a block of multiple frames at once. The rationale is that we may have an opportunity to further enhance quality by considering the relative importance of bits in frames belonging to the same block.</p><p>To illustrate the multiple-frame bit allocation problem, consider a block of three frames, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>(a). Assume that the optimal solution of the single-frame allocation problem determined that senders can transmit up to B 1 = B 2 = B 3 bits for frames 1, 2, and 3. Further, suppose that the frames have the rate-distortion (R-D) curves shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>(b). R-D curves map a given bit rate to the corresponding distortion level (detailed description of R-D curves is given in Section 3). Notice that the R-D curves may differ from one frame to another, because they depend on the temporal and spatial complexities of the frame. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>(b) indicates that transmitting B 1 , B 2 , B 3 bits results in distortion levels D 1 , D 2 , D 3 for frames 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Notice that D 2 is much larger than D 1 and D 3 , which implies large fluctuation in the playout quality of the consecutive frames. Quality fluctuations have a negative impact on the user-perceived quality. Now, consider the same bit budget for the three-frame block, but distributed differently among the frames, as shown in the lower part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>(a). This slight change in bit distribution results in quality improvement in two ways: (i) smaller total distortion in the block; and, more importantly, (ii) much smaller quality fluctuation in successive frames. This is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2(b)</ref>, where the new distortion levels are denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D ′ 1 , D ′ 2 , D ′ 3 .</formula><p>Notice that the decrease in bit rates allocated to frames 1 and 2 result in a minor increase in their distortion levels, while the distortion of frame 2 decreases substantially due to the extra bit rate allocated to it. In summary, solving the bit allocation problem at the block level optimizes the playout quality by getting the maximum number of bits from senders, and by carefully distributing these bits among frames using rate-distortion curves.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D ′ 1 D ′ 3 D 3</formula><p>(b) Rate-distortion curves for three consecutive frames in a block In this paper, we formulate and optimally solve the single-frame bit allocation problem, and we experimentally show the effectiveness of our solutions in improving the video playout quality. In particular, we make the following contributions. First, we formulate the single-frame allocation problem as an optimization problem with an objective function to minimize the distortion. By using the piece-wise linear rate-distortion model, we transform the general (nonlinear) optimization problem into an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. We design a simple rounding scheme that transforms the ILP problem into a linear programming (LP) one, which could be solved efficiently using common optimization techniques such as the Simplex method. We prove that our rounding scheme always produces a feasible solution, and the solution is within a negligible margin from the optimal one. Second, we propose a new algorithm (FGSAssign) for the single-frame allocation problem that runs in O(n log n) steps, where n is the number of senders. We prove that FGSAssign is optimal. We solve the multiple-frame allocation problems in the extended version of this paper. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We discuss related work in Section 2. Section 3 presents and validates the rate-distortion model adopted in this paper. In Section 4, we formulate the single-frame allocation problems, and we present our rounding scheme. In Section 5, we present the new FGSAssign algorithm, and we prove its optimality. We evaluate our algorithm and compare it against the optimal one in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>Distributed and peer-to-peer streaming has recently received significant research attention. For example, the distributed video streaming framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> shows the feasibility and benefits of streaming from multiple servers to a single receiver. The receiver uses a rate allocation algorithm to determine the sending rate for each server to minimize the total packet loss. A tomography-based sender selection protocol is proposed in 1 to optimize quality at the receiver. Both work do not consider scalable-coded streams. Layered-scalable streams are considered in 3 and 2 to cope with the bandwidth heterogeneity. In, 3 the multi-sender streaming problem is formulated to maximize the streaming quality of all peers and minimize the load on the originating media distributor. The authors of 2 design practical algorithms to adapt to bandwidth dynamics. Different from our work, these two studies employ coarse-grained scalability, and they are not R-D optimized.</p><p>Su and Wang consider a minimization problem for the transmission time of FGS-encoded images in. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> They formulate the problem as a nonlinear program, and then they transform it to a series of LP subproblems. Each LP subproblem determines a peer allocation to maximize the number of received bits in a given delay bound. Unlike our work, the work in 6 does not consider the characteristics of the R-D curves of video sequences. A framework to solve the problem of streaming interdependent packetized video data units over lossy networks in R-D optimized fashion is proposed in. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> This framework has been generalized by many researchers from various perspectives. For instance, 8 and 9 consider the multiple server video streaming problem in R-D optimized way. However, they concentrate on nonscalable and layered coded streams, and do not explicitly specify any R-D models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RATE-DISTORTION MODELS</head><p>Rate-distortion (R-D) models are functions that map bit rates to expected distortion-and hence perceived quality-level. Since we are interested in optimizing quality at various rates, we need accurate R-D models. Several analytic R-D models for FGS-encoded sequences have been proposed, e.g., the square-root model, 10 the logarithm model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and the Generalized Gaussian model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> The accuracy and complexity of various FGS R-D models are studied in. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> In each one of these analytic models, the distortion is related to the rate with a nonlinear function. Nonlinear R-D functions make our bit allocation problem (described in Section 4) a nonlinear optimization problem, which is hard (if at all feasible) to solve.</p><p>Another approach for obtaining R-D models is by empirically measuring the distortion at various bit rates. Since the range of possible bit rates for the enhancement layer is typically large (order of Mbps), too many sample bit rates are needed to obtain accurate R-D models. This requires decoding the video sequence many times, which is computationally expensive <ref type="bibr">[14, page 302]</ref>. A third approach for constructing R-D models is to empirically measure distortion only at a few carefully chosen bit rates and interpolate the R-D curve between these points based on some inherent characteristics of the enhancement layer. The piece-wise linear R-D model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> which we adopt in this paper, falls into this category.</p><p>In the following subsections, we first present the piece-wise linear R-D model and how we extract its parameters from video sequences. Then, we experimentally show its accuracy. Finally, we discuss important properties of this model which we will employ in the formulation and solution of our bit allocation problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The Piece-wise Linear R-D Model</head><p>The key idea of the piece-wise linear model 15 (we refer to it simply as the linear model) is that within each bitplane the R-D curve can be approximated by a line segment. Line segments of different bitplanes have different slopes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(a) shows an example. The problem of finding the R-D function is now reduced to measuring the distortion at bit rates that correspond to bitplane boundaries (up to 8 samples in most cases), and computing the slopes of the different line segments.</p><p>Building and storing the linear R-D model for a given sequence is quite efficient. We first identify the bitplane boundaries from the header inserted in each bitplane during the FGS encoding process. We compute the size of each bitplane h, and denote it by l h . If there are z bitplanes, we decode the sequence z + 1 times but in each time we truncate the enhancement layer at a different bitplane boundary. After decoding we compute the distortion-in mean-square error (MSE)-between the original and reconstructed sequences. Then we compute the slope g h for each bitplane h. The R-D model parameters are extracted only once and stored in a meta file. We need to store only the size of each bitplane and the slope of the line segment in that bitplane. The meta file adds a negligible storage overhead, up to 64 bytes per frame. Frames sizes are usually in order of tens of kilo bytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Accuracy of the Linear R-D Model</head><p>Since the accuracy of the adopted R-D model is crucial to our problem, we validate the accuracy of the linear R-D model. To do so, we compare the accuracy of the linear model against the actual R-D curves, which are obtained as follows. We select six equally-spaced sampling rates on each bitplane. Then, we compute the actual distortion by decoding and comparing the original and reconstructed sequences at each sampling rate. We carry out the comparison over several video sequences of different temporal and spatial complexities. rigorous validation, we compute the absolute error between the actual and linear model curves at all sampling rates. We compute the average error per frame, and we repeat that for all frames in the considered sequences. The results (plots are given in 5 ) confirm the accuracy of the linear R-D model: the average error is less than 2% in almost all cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Properties of the Linear R-D Model</head><p>By examining a large set of R-D parameters for many frames, we found that curves produced by the linear model has the following property: The slopes of the line segments form a monotonically increasing series, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g 1 &lt; g 2 &lt; · · · &lt; g z &lt; 0</formula><p>, where g h is the slope of line segment in bitplane h <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> demonstrates this property. This is intuitive because the most significant bitplanes carry higher significant bits, and thus the per-bit reduction in distortion is higher. This means that the most significant bitplanes will have steeper and more negative slopes.</p><p>While the above explanation of slope monotonicity makes sense, we have seen a few anomalies. For instance, frame 2 of Foreman has g 1 = −0.15 &gt; −1.8 = g 2 . Almost all anomalies occurred between bitplanes 1 and 2. From further examination, we found that the anomalies occur when the size of the first bitplane is very small, around 100 bytes or less . At that small size, the overhead of the bitplane header becomes significant, which negatively impacts the effective per-bit reduction in distortion (i.e., the slope) for bits in bitplane 1. We also notice that the smaller the size of bitplane 1, the higher the negative impact.</p><p>Because some of the proofs of our optimal bit allocation problem require the monotonicity of the slopes, we propose a simple processing of linear R-D curves to maintain monotonicity: we aggregate any two neighboring bitplanes into a single bitplane whenever there is a violation in monotonicity. For instance, the rightmost subfigure of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the slopes before and after bitplane aggregation. Notice that if bitplane aggregation is needed, it is almost always sufficient to aggregate the first two planes, and in very rare cases between the second and third bitplanes. To verify this, we examined slopes of all bitplanes of all frames in four video sequences: Akiyo, Mother, Foreman, and Mobile. We found that only two pairs of consecutive bitplanes out of 5734 total bitplanes violated the monotonicity property. Furthermore, these two violations can be eliminated by two more bitplane aggregations (details are given in 5 ).</p><p>Finally, we examined the impact of the bitplane aggregation on the accuracy of the transformed linear R-D curves. We repeat the accuracy assessment experiments in the previous subsection, but using linear R-D curves after bitplane aggregation is performed on them. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(c)</ref> shows that the average error between the modified linear R-D curves and the actual ones is the same as the (untransformed) linear R-D curves, which is less than 2% in almost all cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">THE BIT ALLOCATION PROBLEM: FORMULATION AND SOLUTION</head><p>In this section, we consider the bit allocation problem for multi-sender video streaming systems that use FGS encoded streams. We assume the base layer is coded at a reasonably low bit rate and can be transmitted through a reliable channel. Our goal is to develop a practical algorithm for many-to-one streaming sessions such that the available resources are intelligently allocated to achieve the maximal perceptual streaming quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Problem Formulation</head><p>The bit allocation problem we address in this paper can be stated as follows. Given multiple senders that can potentially serve an FGS-encoded video sequence to a receiver, where senders have different portions of the sequence and have different outgoing bandwidth, and the receiver has a limit on the incoming bandwidth. Determine the streaming rate and the range of bits allocated to each sender to achieve the best possible video quality at the receiver. It is assumed that the base layer is coded at a low, and fixed bit rate and can be reliably delivered by any sender. We seek to optimize the streaming of the enhancement layer because it contributes significantly larger bit rates than the base layer, and unlike the base layer, its bit rate can be controlled.</p><p>We address this problem in two steps. First, we optimize the quality of individual frames of the sequence. That is, we formulate and solve the problem for each frame. In the second step, we divide the sequence into blocks of frames, each has a fixed number of frames. Then, we formulate and solve the optimization problem for each block. The second step is presented in the extended version of the paper. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> We now formulate the allocation problem for individual frames. Let T denote the frame period in seconds, which is the multiplicative inverse of the frame rate. T is fixed for all frames in the considered sequence. Assume there are n potential senders, each with outgoing bandwidth b i (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). Each sender i holds s i contiguous bits, which is a portion of the enhancement layer bit stream. Without loss of generality, we assume that s 1 ≤ s 2 ≤ · · · ≤ s n , otherwise we re-label senders to achieve that. Note that the nature of FGS-encoded sequences implies that a lower quality bit stream is always a subset of a higher quality one. That is, s i is always a prefix of s i+1 for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. The receiver incoming bandwidth is denoted by b I .</p><p>Solving the allocation problem should yield an allocation policy A = {(∆ i , r i )|i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, where ∆ i is the number of bits allocated to peer i and r i ≤ b i is its streaming rate. Bits are allocated to peers as follows. Peer 1 transmits the range from 0 to ∆ 1 − 1, peer 2 transmits from ∆ 1 to ∆ 1 + ∆ 2 − 1, and in general peer i transmits from i−1 t=1 ∆ t to i t=1 ∆ t − 1. Mathematically, the bit allocation problem for a given frame can be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min A D( n t=1 ∆ t ) (1a) s.t. ∆ i − r i T ≤ 0 (1b) i t=1 ∆ t ≤ s i (1c) r i ≤ b i (1d) n t=1 r t ≤ b I (1e) ∆ i , r i ∈ N; i = 1, 2, . . . , n.<label>(1f)</label></formula><p>The objective function in (1a) is to find the optimal allocation A * that minimizes the reconstruction distortion, and hence maximizes the rendered quality. The constraints can be explained as follows: (1b) ensures that each sender has enough time to transmit all bits allocated to it (∆ i − r i T ≤ 0 =⇒ ∆ i /r i ≤ T ). (1c) ensures that the allocated bits to each sender are within the portion of bits stored at that sender, while (1d) and (1e) ensure that the limits on the incoming and outgoing bandwidth of the receiver and senders are not exceeded.</p><p>In order to solve this optimization problem, we need the mapping between the distortion and total number of bits received. Note that dividing the total number of bits by the (fixed) frame period T yields the bit rate. As we discussed in Section 3, we adopt the linear R-D model for this mapping because: (i) it is fairly accurate, (ii) its parameters can be efficiently extracted from the video sequence, and more importantly, (iii) it results in a linear objective function and hence efficient solution of the optimization problem. Recall that the linear R-D model divides the R-D curve into several line segments, each corresponds to a bitplane h and has a different slope g h (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(a)</ref>). The slope g h represents the per-bit reduction in the distortion in bitplane h. Therefore, in order to compute the total distortion for a possible bit allocation, we need to find how many bits are transmitted from each bitplane. To do that, we introduce a new variable y h (h = 1, 2, . . . , z) to represent the number of bits transmitted from bitplane h. z is the number of bitplanes in the enhancement layer of the considered frame. Now the distortion can be computed as d + z h=1 g h y h , where d is the distortion when only the base layer is transmitted. The optimization problem in (1) can be re-written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min A D( n t=1 ∆ t ) = d + z v=1 g v y v (2a) s.t. ∆ i − r i T ≤ 0 (2b) i t=1 ∆ t ≤ s i (2c) r i ≤ b i (2d) n t=1 r t ≤ b I (2e) y h ≤ l h (2f) n t=1 ∆ t = z v=1 y v (2g) ∆ i , r i , y h ∈ N; i = 1, 2, . . . , n; h = 1, 2, . . . , z.<label>(2h)</label></formula><p>Notice the two new constrains in (2f) and (2g). (2f) makes sure that the number of bits transmitted from a bitplane does not exceed the size of that bitplane, whereas (2g) ensures that the total number of bits transmitted from different bitplanes is exactly the same as the number of bits allocated to senders.</p><p>Unlike <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> is an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, because the objective function as well as all constraints are linear. While ILP problems are less complex than nonlinear problems, they are still NP-hard <ref type="bibr">[16, page 777]</ref>. In the next section, we present a rounding scheme that transforms the ILP problem in (2) to a linear programming (LP) problem, which can be solved using the Simplex method or other efficient LP solvers. But before doing so, we need to make sure that the optimal solution for the ILP in (2) will produce a valid FGS-encoded bit stream. An FGS-encoded bit stream is valid if it has a contiguous stream of bits with no gaps between them. If there is a gap in the bit stream, the FGS decoder will ignore the rest of the bit stream beyond the gap, which will reduce the quality. The following lemma proves the validity of the optimal solution of (2). LEMMA 1. An optimal solution for (2) produces a contiguous FGS-encoded bit stream with no bit gaps.</p><p>Proof. To prove this lemma, we need to show that no bits from a bitplane j will be transmitted before all bits of bitplanes h &lt; j are transmitted, where h, j = 1, 2, . . . , z and z is the number of bitplanes. That is, we need to show that if an optimal allocation results in y * j 񮽙 = 0 for any j = 2, 3, . . . , z, then it must be the case that y * h = l h , where h = 1, 2, . . . , j − 1, and l h is the size of bitplane h. We prove this by contradiction.</p><p>Assume that the optimal allocation A * produced y * j 񮽙 = 0 and there exists y * h &lt; l h for some h &lt; j. We construct another allocation A which is exactly the same as A * , except we shift q = min(y * j , l h − y * h ) &gt; 0 bits from bitplane j to bitplane h. A is indeed a feasible allocation because it satisfies all the constraints in (2). Furthermore, the distortion associated with A is given by D = D * + (g h − g j )q &lt; D * , since g h is always less than g j because slopes are monotonically increasing, as discussed in Section 3. This is a contradiction because D * is supposed to be the minimum distortion.</p></div>

Our LP formulation of the bit allocation problem is exactly the same as (2), except the constraint in (2h) is now relaxed to be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∆ i , r i , y h ∈ R + ∪ {0}; i = 1, 2, . . . , n; h = 1, 2, . . . , z.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Let A = {( ∆ i , r i )|i = 1, 2, . . . , n} be the optimal allocation produced by solving the LP problem. ∆ i , r i are in general non-negative real numbers. To obtain integer solutions for the original ILP problem, we propose the following rounding scheme:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r i = ⌊ r i ⌋, and ∆ i = ⌊ ∆ i b ri−1 b ri ⌋, r i &gt; 1 0, 0 ≤ r i ≤ 1<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In the following two lemmas, we prove that this rounding scheme indeed produces a feasible solution, and that solution is very close to the optimal one.</p><p>LEMMA 2. Rounding of the optimal solution of the relaxed linear programming problem using the rounding scheme in (4) always produces a feasible solution for the integer linear programming problem defined in (2).</p><p>Proof. We only need to prove that constraint (2b) is satisfied, that is, we need to show that ∆ i − r i T ≤ 0. Notice that all other constraints are automatically satisfied because we round down both of r i and ∆ i .</p><p>We first consider the case when r i &gt; 1. For any i = 1, 2, . . . , n, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∆ i r i = ⌊ ∆ i b ri−1 b ri ⌋ ⌊ r i ⌋ ≤ ∆ i b ri−1 b ri ⌊ r i ⌋ &lt; ∆ i b ri−1 b ri r i − 1 = ∆ i r i ≤ T,</formula><p>where the first inequality (from the left) is from the definition of the floor function, and the second inequality is due to the fact that ⌊ r i ⌋ &gt; r i −1. Next we consider the case when 0 ≤ r i ≤ 1. In this case, ∆ i = 0. Therefore, ∆ i −r i T = −r i T ≤ 0, because r i ≥ 0, and the constraint is satisfied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEMMA 3. The rounding scheme in (4) results in a total number of bits that is smaller than the optimal number of bits by</head><p>at most nT + n, where n is the number of senders and T is the frame period.</p><p>Proof. We first compute the gap between the optimal and rounded solutions for an arbitrary sender i, where i = 1, 2, . . . , n. If r i &gt; 1, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∆ i − ∆ i = ∆ i − ⌊ ∆ i r i − 1 r i ⌋ &lt; ∆ i − ∆ i r i − 1 r i + 1 = ∆ i r i + 1 ≤ T + 1. If 0 ≤ r i ≤ 1, we have ∆ i − ∆ i = ∆ i ≤ r i T ≤ T &lt; T + 1.</formula><p>Therefore, the gap for any sender is bounded by T + 1. Thus for all n senders, the gap is at most nT + n.</p><p>Lemma 3 shows that the gap between the solution resulted from our rounding scheme and the optimal one is negligible. To put this gap into perspective, consider an extreme-case streaming session in which 30 senders are concurrently streaming to a single receiver. Assume that the frame rate is 15 frames per second. Then, the gap is at most 30/15 + 30 = 32 bits. That is, the rounded solution may transmit at most 4 bytes less than the optimal one from any given frame, which is indeed negligible given that frame sizes are in the order of kilo bytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">FGSASSIGN: AN OPTIMAL ALGORITHM FOR THE SINGLE-FRAME BIT ALLOCATION PROBLEM</head><p>The LP formulation of the bit allocation problems, presented in the previous section, can be solved by the Simplex method. On average, the Simplex method is efficient, but it has a worst-case exponential running time <ref type="bibr">[17, Section 8.6]</ref>. While there exist worst-case polynomial time methods (e.g., Karmarkar's interior-point algorithm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> for solving general LP optimization problems, they are quite complex to implement, and they have very large average running times, which in many cases exceed the average running time of the Simplex method.</p><p>We propose a greedy algorithm, called FGSAssign, to efficiently solve the single frame bit allocation problem. The pseudo code for the algorithm is given <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>. The basic idea of the algorithm is to transmit the maximum possible number of bits from each senders. It does so by first sorting all senders based on the portion of the stream stored at each sender, such that s 1 ≤ s 2 ≤ · · · ≤ s n . Then, it sequentially allocates to sender i (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) the maximum number Sort all senders based on s i , where s 1 ≤ s 2 ≤ · · · ≤ s n ; 2.</p><p>x 0 = · · · = x n = 0; ∆ 1 = · · · = ∆ n = 0; r agg = 0; 3.</p><p>for i = 1 to n do 4.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x i = min(x i−1 + b i T, s i ); 5. r i = (x i − x i−1 )/T ; 6.</formula><p>if (r agg + r i &lt; b I ) then 7.</p><p>r agg = r agg + r i ; 8.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∆ i = x i − x i−1 ; 9. else 10. r i = b I − r agg ; 11. ∆ i = T × r i ; 12.</formula><p>return 13. endfor of bits which sender i can transmit within the frame period T . The allocated bits must be available at sender i, i.e., they are a subset of s i , and they do not overlap with bits allocated to j (1 ≤ j &lt; i). Thus FGSAssign avoids holes as well as overlapping of bits among senders. Therefore, the allocation will result in a contiguous bit stream, which is necessary for decoding FGS-encoded enhancement layers. The following theorem proves that FGSAssign is optimal and efficient. THEOREM 1. The FGSAssign algorithm terminates in O(n log n) steps, where n is the number of senders, and it produces an allocation that minimizes the distortion of individual frames.</p><p>Proof. The termination and time complexity part is straightforward: sorting of s i 's takes O(n log n) steps and the for-loop iterates up to n times, each taking a constant number of operations.</p><p>For the optimality part, we first notice that for individual frames, sending more bits always results in smaller distortion. Therefore, sending the maximum number of bits corresponds to the minimum distortion. The maximum number of bits is determined based on either: (i) the receiver incoming bandwidth b I , or (ii) senders outgoing bandwidth b i and portions of stream stored s i (1 ≤ i ≤ n). In the first case, because s i 's are sorted, the algorithm fills up the entire receiver's bandwidth with non overlapping bits and returns from the for-loop in line 12. Thus the maximum number of bits will be transmitted.</p><p>In the second case, the algorithm terminates after finishing n iterations of the for-loop. In every iteration i of the forloop, the algorithm assigns to sender i the maximum number of bits that this sender can transmit, constrained only by the outgoing bandwidth b i and the length of the stored portion of the stream s i . In other words, the algorithm makes a greedy decision (∆ i , r i ), and solves a subproblem in the i + 1 iteration. To prove that this greedy approach is optimal, we show that the problem has two properties: greedy-choice and optimal substructure <ref type="bibr">[16, Chapter 16]</ref>.</p><p>The greedy-choice property guarantees that a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by a greedy choice. Suppose {(∆ * u , r * u )|u = i, i + 1, . . . , n} is an optimal solution to the original problem in iteration i. Since (∆ i , r i ) is a greedy choice, we have ∆ i ≥ ∆ * i (and r i ≥ r * i ). Now, we construct a new solution from the optimal one by shifting bits from other peers to i, such that the new solution contains the greedy decision. Obviously, the number of bits remains the same, thus, we have an optimal solution consists of the greedy choice.</p><p>The optimal substructure property ensures that combining a greedy decision with an optimal solution to the subproblem results in an optimal solution to the original problem. We prove this property by contradiction. Consider iteration i. Suppose the combination of the greedy decision (∆ i , r i ) and a subproblem optimal solution {(∆ v , r v )|v = i + 1, i + 2, . . . , n} is not an optimal solution to the original problem. Thus, we can find an optimal solution</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">{(∆ * u , r * u )|u = i, i + 1, . . . , n} such that n u=i ∆ * u &gt; n v=i ∆ v . Since ∆ i ≥ ∆ * i</formula><p>by the greedy decision, we must have n u=i+1 ∆ * i &gt; n v=i+1 ∆ v , which is a contradiction because n v=i+1 ∆ v is assumed to be an optimal solution to the subproblem. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the importance of the scalable allocation problem, and we verify the optimality of our FGSAssign algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Experimental Setup</head><p>Software used and developed. In our experiments, we use the MPEG-4 Reference Software Version 2.5 19 developed by Microsoft as an experimental package for the MPEG-4 standard. It is implemented in C++ and contains three major executables: encoder, decoder, and fgs server. We instrument the reference software to extract various statistics of a video sequence. For instance, we collect the transform coefficients, number of bitplanes, and size of each bitplane in the enhancement layer. This information is used to estimate the parameters of the linear R-D model.</p><p>We have implemented the FGSAssign algorithm ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>) and the optimal algorithm (referred to as OPT) using the Simplex method. For comparisons, we have also implemented the nonscalable allocation algorithm discussed in Section 1. All allocation algorithms are implemented in Matlab. We run the experiments on a 3.0 GHz Pentium 4 workstation running Windows XP.</p><p>Streaming scenarios and video test sequences. To compare the performance of the allocation algorithms, we design four representative streaming scenarios, which we believe capture various Internet and Intranet streaming settings. In the first scenario, we consider a receiver using a high-speed connection with enough incoming bandwidth to receive full quality stream, and four senders with 512 kbps, 256 kbps, 1.5 Mbps, and 3 Mbps outgoing bandwidth. The two senders with lower outgoing bandwidth represent peers with cable modem or ADSL connections, while the other two could be office or campus workstations. Due to the asymmetry between incoming and outgoing bandwidth, peers typically receive video streams with higher bit rates (quality) than they could serve to others. Therefore, we assume that the senders store different version of the FGS-encoded stream: 512 kbps, 4 Mbps, 8 Mbps, and 10 Mbps, respectively.</p><p>The second scenario assumes the receiver has 1 Mbps incoming bandwidth, and there are six senders. Four of them subscribe to 128 kbps uplink access service while the other two only have 64 kbps uplink. Among those four 128 kbps senders, three of them store 1 Mbps version of the coded stream, and the last one stores a 512 kbps version. All others have a 128 kbps version of the stream. The third scenario simulates an Intranet video casting that is very common nowadays. Suppose there are four senders at different facilities, each of them has 1.5 Mbps connection. The receiver, located at a regional center, has larger bandwidth of 3 Mbps. Senders store four different versions of the stream: 256 kbps, 512 kbps, 4 Mbps, and 4Mbps, respectively. The forth scenario has five senders: four of them have 256 kbps outgoing bandwidth and store a 1.5 Mbps coded stream. The last sender has 512 kbps outgoing bandwidth and holds a 512 kbps coded version of the stream. The receiver has 1.5 Mbps incoming bandwidth. In all scenarios, we stream a set of video sequences with different characteristics. To form this set of test sequences, we have analyzed twenty representative video sequences from various sources. We categorize sequences into three complexity classes based on the average spatial and temporal complexities of each sequence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> We present results for two sequences: Foreman and Mobile. Both are coded at 30 fps, and have a CIF (352x288) resolution. Foreman sequence is a lowcomplexity sequence and has a scene cut, where the second scene has more details than the first one. Mobile contains saturated colors and several moving objects, and therefore is a high-complexity sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Results</head><p>We present a sample of our results in this section due to space limitations, more results are available in. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Scalable versus nonscalable allocation. Our results clearly confirm the potential quality improvement from using scalable allocation algorithms over the nonscalable ones: In all considered streaming scenarios and with all test sequences, there was at least 1 dB and up to 8 dB improvement in quality (see plots for all cases in 5 ). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows a sample plot for streaming of Foreman in scenario I, where we see an average quality improvement of at least 5 dB. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> demonstrates streaming of Mobile in scenario III. The figure shows more than 3 dB quality improvement.</p><p>Optimality of FGSAssign. To verify our analytic results regarding the optimality of the FGSAssign, we compare the distortion achieved by solving the LP problem using the Simplex method versus the distortion achieved by the FGSAssign algorithm. In all cases, FGSAssign produced exactly the same distortion values as the optimal as indicated in Figures 6(a) and 7(a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we formulated and solved the bit allocation problem for FGS-encoded video sequences streamed in distributed and heterogeneous environments. The formulation was done in a number of steps. First a general optimization problem was formed, which is transformed to an integer linear programming (ILP) one. Then using a simple rounding scheme, the ILP problem is transformed to a linear programming problem. We proposed an optimal allocation algorithm (FGSAssign) for the single-frame allocation problem. Our experimental results show that solving the bit allocation problem using our algorithm could provide significant quality improvement over solving it using the nonscalable algorithm: An improvement of up to 8 dB could be achieved in some cases. The quality improvement is even higher when allocating bits to blocks of multiple frames. This is because multiple frame allocation provides more chances for optimization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 compares</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 compares various possible solutions for the allocation problem, and the quality of the received stream in each case. In Figure 1(a), a nonscalable allocation scheme is considered, which assumes that the video stream is encoded using a nonscalable encoder. In nonscalable encoding, the stream has to be downloaded in its entirety, otherwise it is not decodable. In this case, senders are considered to have different versions of the same stream. Therefore, under the nonscalable allocation scheme, the receiver can only get the 128 Kbps stream version. Notice that collaboration among senders is not possible, because the versions they have are encoded differently. Nonscalable encoding is actually not uncommon in current Internet streaming systems: Many streaming servers post the same video clip in different rates to accommodate users with heterogeneous bandwidth. To cope with the inflexibility of nonscalable encoding, some streaming systems encode a stream into multiple layers. Typically, there are a few number of layers, because of the layering overhead and the complexity of the coding/decoding processes. In layered scalable coding, partial layers are not decodable.
