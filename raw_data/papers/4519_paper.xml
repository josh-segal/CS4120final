				<p>In this paper, we propose a fixed point theory to solve games of imperfect information. The fixed point theory is defined on the lattice of antichains of sets of states. Contrary to the classical solution proposed by Reif [Rei84], our new solution does not involve determinization. As a consequence, it is readily applicable to classes of systems that do not admit determinization. Notable examples of such systems are timed and hybrid automata. As an application, we show that the discrete control problem for games of imperfect information defined by rectangular automata is decidable. This result extends a result by Henzinger and Kopke in [HK99].</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Timed and hybrid systems are dynamical systems with both discrete and continuous components. A paradigmatic example of a hybrid system is a digital control program for an analog plant environment, like a furnace or an airplane: the controller state moves discretely between control modes, and in each control mode, the plant state evolves continuously according to physical laws. A natural model for hybrid systems is the hybrid automaton, which represents discrete components using finite-state machines and continuous components using real-numbered variables whose evolution is governed by differential equations or differential inclusions <ref type="bibr">[ACH + 95]</ref>.</p><p>The distinction between continuous evolutions of the plant state (which is given by the real-numbered variables of a hybrid automaton) and discrete switches of the controller state (which is given by the location, or control mode, of the hybrid automaton) permits a natural formulation of the safety control problem: given an unsafe set U of plant states, is there a strategy to switch the controller state in real time so that the plant can be prevented from entering U ? In other words, the hybrid automaton specifies a set of possible control modes, together with the plant behavior resulting from each mode, and the control problem asks for deriving a switching strategy between control modes that keeps the plant out of trouble.</p><p>In the literature, there are algorithms or semi-algorithms (termination is not always guaranteed) to derive such switching strategy. Those semi-algorithms usually comes in the form of symbolic fixed point computations that manipulate sets of states using a well-suited monotonic function like the controllable predecessor operator <ref type="bibr">[AHK02,MPS95]</ref>. Those algorithms make a strong hypothesis: they consider that the controller that executes the switching strategy has a perfect information about the state of the controlled system. Unfortunately, this is usually an unreasonable hypothesis. Indeed, when the switching strategy has to be implemented by a real hardware, the controller typically acquires information about the state of the system by reading values on sensors. Those sensors have finite precision, and so the information about the state in which the system lies is imperfect. Let us illustrate this. Consider a controller that monitors the temperature of a tank, and has to maintain the temperature between given bounds by switching on and off a gas burner. The temperature of the tank is the state of the continuous system to control. Assume that the temperature is sensed through a thermometer that returns an integer number and ensures a deviation bounded by one degree Celsius. So, when the sensor returns the temperature c, the controller only knows that the temperature lies in the interval (c − 1, c + 1) degrees. We say that the sensor reading is an observation of the system. This observation gives an imperfect information about the state of the system. Now, if we fix a set of possible observations of the system to control, the control problem that we want to solve is the safety control problem with imperfect information: "given an unsafe set U of plant states, a set of observations, is there an observation based strategy to switch the controller state in real time so that the plant can be prevented from entering U ?". While it is well-known that safety games of perfect information can be won using memoryless strategies, it is not the case for games of imperfect information <ref type="bibr">[Rei84]</ref>. In that paper, Reif studies games of incomplete information which are a subclass of safety games of imperfect information where the set of observations is a partition of the state space. Notice that this is not the case of our tank example since when the temperature of the water is d, the thermometer may return either d or d. To win such games, memory is sometimes necessary: the controller has to remember (part of) the history of observations that it has made so far. In the finite state case, games of incomplete information can be solved algorithmically. Reif proposes an algorithm that first transforms the game of incomplete information into a game of perfect information using a kind of determinization procedure.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an alternative method to solve games of imperfect (and incomplete) information. Our method comes in the form of a fixed point (semi-)algorithm that iterates a monotone operator on the lattice of antichains of sets of states. The greatest fixed point of this operator contains exactly the information needed to determine the states from which an observation based control strategy exists and to synthesize such a strategy. We prove that our algorithm has an optimal complexity for finite state games and we identify a class of infinite state games for which the greatest fixed point of the operator is computable. Using this class of games and results from <ref type="bibr">[HK99]</ref>, we show that the discrete-time control problem with imperfect information is decidable for the class of rectangular automata. Strategies that win those games are robust as they can be implemented using hardware that senses its environment with finite precision.</p><p>Our fixed point method has several advantages over the algorithmic method proposed by Reif. First, as it does not require determinization, our (semi-)algorithm is readily applicable to classes of systems for which determinization is not effective: timed and hybrid automata are notable examples <ref type="bibr">[AD94]</ref>. Second, we show that there are families of games on which the Reif's algorithm needs exponential time when our algorithm only needs polynomial time. Third, as our method is based on a lattice theory, abstract interpretation methods can be used to derive in a systematic way approximation algorithms <ref type="bibr">[CC77]</ref>.</p><p>Our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we recall the definition of the lattice of antichains. In Section 3, we show how to use this lattice to solve games of imperfect information. In Section 4, we give a fixed point algorithm that is EXPTIME for finite state games and we compare with the technique of Reif. Finally, in Section 5, we solve games of imperfect information for rectangular automata. Due to lack of space, the proofs of most of the theorems have been omitted and can be found in <ref type="bibr">[DDR06]</ref> </p></div>

An antichain on a partially ordered set X, ≤ is a set X ⊆ X such that for any x 1 , x 2 ∈ X with x 1 񮽙 = x 2 we have neither x 1 ≤ x 2 nor x 2 ≤ x 1 , that is X is a set of incomparable elements of X.

The reduced form of q is q = q\Dom(q) and dually the expanded form of q is q = q ∪ Dom(q). The set q is an antichain of 2 S , ⊆. Observe that Dom(q) = ∅, that is ∀s, s ∈ q : if s 1 ⊆ s 2 then s 1 = s 2 . The relation has the useful following properties:</p><p>Lemma 1 Let q, q ∈ 2 2 S . If q ⊆ q then q q .

Furthermore, given a set Σ ⊆ Σ c ∪ Σ u , we define the notation Post Σ (s) to mean σ∈Σ Post σ (s).

We denote by Win the set {q | q = CPre(q)} which is the greatest fixed point of CPre. Condition (1) states that any observation of the initial state x 0 suffices to determine in which set s of Win the game has been started. Since Win is a fixed point of the controllable predecessor operator, we know that in each set s of Win we have a controllable action that can be played by the controller in every state x ∈ s such that (i) the state z reached after the move of the environment lies in one of the sets s of Win whatever the environment does and, such that (ii) the set s can be determined using any observation compatible with z. Following this, there exists a winning strategy if Condition (1) holds. The other direction of the theorem is a direct consequence of Tarski's Theorem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof of Theorem 12.</head><p>First, we give an effective construction of a winning strategy for G, in the form of a finite automaton. For q ∈ L and σ ∈ Σ c , let φ(q, σ) = {s ∈ S | s ⊆ Enabled(σ) and ∀obs ∈ Obs, ∃s ∈ q : Post Σ u (Post σ (s)) ∩ γ(obs) ⊆ s } be the set of controllable predecessors of q for the action σ. From the greatest fixed point Win of CPre, we define the finite state automaton A = Q, q 0 , L, δ where -Q = Win ∪ {q 0 } where q 0 / ∈ Win, -q 0 is the initial state, -L : Q\{q 0 } → Σ c is a labeling of the states. For each s ∈ Win, we choose σ ∈ Σ c such that s ∈ φ(Win, σ) and we fix L(s) = σ (such a σ exists since Win is a fixed point of CPre). -δ : Q × Obs → Q is a transition function.</p><p>• For each obs ∈ Obs, choose s ∈ Win such that S 0 ∩ γ(obs) ⊆ s and fix δ(q 0 , obs) = s; • For each s ∈ Win and obs ∈ Obs, choose s ∈ Win such that Post Σ u (Post σ (s)) ∩ γ(obs) ⊆ s where σ = L(s) and fix δ(s, obs) = s . Such sets s, s exist by condition (1).</p><p>In this automaton, states are labelled with actions and transitions are labelled with observations. Intuitively, a state s of A corresponds to the minimal knowledge that is sufficient to control the system and the label L(s) is a winning move the controller can play having this knowledge. The next state s is determined by the observation obs according to the transition relation.</p><p>LetˆδLetˆ Letˆδ : Q×Obs + → Q be an extension of the transition function δ on words defined recursively byˆδbyˆ byˆδ(s, obs) = δ(s, obs) andˆδandˆ andˆδ(s, obs.obs) = δ( ˆ δ(s, obs), obs). The strategy defined by A is λ : Obs + → Σ c such that λ(obs) = L(s) ifˆδifˆ ifˆδ(q 0 , obs) = s. If for some obs there is no s such thatˆδthatˆ thatˆδ(q 0 , obs) = s, then the sequence of observations obs is impossible. In this case, we can set λ(obs) to any value. Now we proceed with the proof of the theorem.</p><p>-If <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(1)</ref> holds. We show that the strategy λ defined by A is such that for any (x, obs) ∈ Outcome λ (G), we have (i) last(x) ∈ ˆ δ(q 0 , obs) and (ii) last(x) ∈ Enabled(λ(obs)) (thus λ is winning) . We show this by induction on the length of x and obs.</p><p>1. |x| = 1. We have x = x 0 and obs = obs 0 with x 0 ∈ S 0 and x 0 ∈ γ(obs 0 ). Let s = ˆ δ(q 0 , obs 0 ) and σ = L(s) = λ(obs 0 ). By construction of A, we have S 0 ∩ γ(obs 0 ) ⊆ s and s ∈ Win. As x 0 ∈ s and Win is a fixed point of CPre, we have (i) last(x) ∈ ˆ δ(q 0 , obs 0 ) and (ii) x 0 ∈ Enabled(λ(obs 0 )). 2. |x| &gt; 0. We have x = x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x k and obs = obs 0 , obs 1 , . . . , obs k with x k ∈ γ(obs k ). Let s k−1 = ˆ δ(q 0 , obs k−1 ) and σ = L(s k−1 ) = λ(obs k−1 ). By the induction hypothesis, we have x k−1 ∈ s k−1 . For obs = obs k , let s k = δ(s k−1 , obs). By construction of A, we have s k ∈ Win and Post Σ u (Post σ (s k−1 )) ∩ γ(obs) ⊆ s k . Therefore, we have x k ∈ s k and by definition of L, we have s k ⊆ Enabled(σ ) where σ = L(s k ) = λ(obs k ). This yields (i) last(x) ∈ ˆ δ(q 0 , obs) and (ii) x k ∈ Enabled(λ(obs k )). -If λ is an observation based strategy that is winning on G.

Each set is paired with an action that can be played in all the states of that set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">S 1 = CPre({S}) = {{1, 2, 3} a } S 2 = CPre(S 1 ) = {{2} b , {1, 3} a } S 3 = CPre(S 2 ) = {{1} a , {2} b , {3} a } S 4 = CPre(S 3 ) = S 3</formula><p>Since S 4 = S 3 , we have Win = S 3 = {{1}, {2}, {3}}. The existence of a winning strategy is established by condition (1) of Theorem 12 since the sets S 0 ∩γ(obs 1 ) = {2} and S 0 ∩ γ(obs 2 ) = {3} are dominated in Win.</p><p>From the fixed point, using the construction given in the proof of Theorem 12, we construct the automaton of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> which encodes a winning strategy. Indeed, when the game starts the control is either in state 2 if the given observation is obs 1 or in state 3 if the given observation is obs 2 . In the first case, the controller plays b and in the second case, it plays a. Then the game lies in state 1. According to the strategy automaton, the controller plays an a and receives a new observation that allows it to determine if the game lies now in state 2 (obs 1 ) or in state 3 (obs 2 ). From there, the controller can clearly iterate this strategy. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Comparison with the classical technique of [Rei84]</head><p>In [Rei84] the author gives an algorithm to transform a game of incomplete information G into a game G of perfect information on the histories of G.</p><p>The idea can be expressed as follows : given a game of incomplete information G = S, S 0 , Σ c , Σ u , → 1 , Obs, γ define a two-player game G = S , S 0 , Σ c , {ε}, → 2 as follows: S is the set of knowledges K(obs k , σ k−1 ) such that (obs k , σ k−1 ) is an history of G. S 0 is the set of knowledges {K(obs 0 )|γ(obs 0 ) ∩ S 0 񮽙 = ∅}. Finally the transition relation → 2 is defined as follows: K(obs k , σ k−1 ) σ k −→ 2 K(obs k+1 , σ k ) and s ε − → 2 s for all s ∈ S . To obtain the final game of perfect information G , equip G with the set of observation (S , γ I ) where γ I is the identity function. Solving the resulting game of perfect information G requires linear time in the size of S but there exist games of incomplete information G requiring the construction of a game of perfect information of size exponentially larger than the size of G.</p><p>As our algorithm does not require this determinization, it is easy to find families of games where our method is exponentially faster than Reif's algorithm. This is formalized in the next theorem.</p></div>

Let s ∈ CPre(q). For any r ∈ R such that s ∩ r 񮽙 = ∅, we have by Lemma 18 that s ∪ r ∈ CPre(q). Since s ⊆ s ∪ r, we must have s = s ∪ r. This shows that s is R-definable.

A rectangular inequality over X is a formula of the form x i ∼ c, where c is an integer constant, and ∼ is one of the following: &lt;, ≤, &gt;, ≥. A rectangular predicate over X is a conjunction of rectangular inequalities. The set of all rectangular predicates over X is denoted Rect(X). The automaton H has nondecreasing (resp. bounded; nondecreasing or bounded) variables if all n variables of H are nondecreasing (resp. bounded; either nondecreasing or bounded).</p><p>In the sequel, all the rectangular automata that we consider are assumed to be with nondecreasing or bounded variables.</p><p>We now associate a game semantics to each rectangular automaton.</p></div>

Then the environment updates the continuous variables by letting time elapse for 1 time unit as specified by the (nondeterministic) flow predicates. A new round is started from there.

The discrete control problem for games of imperfect information defined by m bounded rectangular automata and m-bounded observation sets is decidable (in 2EXPTIME).</p><p>So far, we do not have a hardness result but we conjecture that the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete. Now, let us illustrate the discrete control problem for games of imperfect information defined by rectangular automata on an example. Example We have implemented our fixed point algorithm using HYTECH and its script language <ref type="bibr">[HHWT95]</ref>. We illustrate the use of the algorithm on a simple example. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> shows a rectangular automaton with four locations and one continuous variable x.</p><p>In this example, the game models a cooling system that controls the temperature x. When requested to start, the system begins to cool down. There are two modes of cooling, either fast or slow, among which the environment chooses. The controller can only observe the system through two observations: H with γ(H) = {(, x) | x ≥ 280} and L with γ(L) = {(, x) | x ≤ 285}. Thus, only the continuous variable x can be observed imperfectly, not the modes. Depending on the mode however, the timing and action to stop the system are different. In the slow mode, the controller has to issue an action a when the temperature is below 280. In the fast mode, the controller has to issue an action b when the temperature is below 270.</p><p>The controller must use its memory of the past observations to make the correct action in time. If the first two observations are H, H then the controller knows that the mode is Slow. If the first two observations are H, L then the controller knows that the mode is Fast.</p><p>The greatest fixed point, given below, allows the computation of the deterministic strategy depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>. The whole process has been automated in HYTECH. The correspondence between state numbers in the figure and states of the fixed point is the following: As before, the strategy associates an action to each set of the fixed point and the observations give the next state of the strategy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>begin 1 Z</head><label>1</label><figDesc>← ∅ ; 2 Wait ← {S} ; 3 while Wait 񮽙 = ∅ do 4 Pick s ∈ Wait of maximal cardinality ; 5 Wait ← Wait\{s} ; 6 if for some σ ∈ Σ c we have : (1) s ⊆ Enabled(σ) and (2) for all obs ∈ Obs, there exists s ∈ q such that PostΣu (Postσ(s)) ∩ γ(obs) ⊆ s then 7 Z ← Z ∪ {s} ; else 8 Wait ← Wait ∪ {s | s ∈ Children(s) ∧ ∀s ∈ Z ∪ Wait : s ⊆ s } ; 9 return Z; end with x i ∈ s i and (x k , obs k ) ∈ Outcome λ (G), since λ is winning on G, we have x k ∈ Enabled(λ(obs)) and thus s ⊆ Enabled(λ(obs)).

For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let [[φ]] i be the projection on variable x i of the set [[φ]]. A set of the form [[φ]], where φ is a rectangular predicate, is called a rectangle. Given a nonnegative integer m ∈ N, the rectangular predicate φ and the rectangle [[φ]] are m-bounded if |c| ≤ m for every conjunct x i ∼ c of φ. Let us denote Rect m (X) the set of m-bounded rectangular predicate on X. Definition 20 [Rectangular automaton] A rectangular automaton H is a tuple Loc, Lab, Edg, X, Init, Inv, Flow, Jump where: -Loc = { 1 , . . . , m } is a finite set of locations; -Lab is a finite set of labels; -Edg ⊆ Loc × Lab × Loc is a finite set of edges; -X = {x 1 , . . . , x n } is a finite set of variables; -Init : Loc → Rect(X) gives the initial condition Init() of location . The automa- ton can start in with an initial valuation v lying in [[Init()]]; -Inv : Loc → Rect(X) gives the invariant condition Inv() of location . The au- tomaton can stay in as long as the values of its variables lie in [[Inv()]]; -Flow : Loc → Rect( ˙ X) governs the evolution of the variables in each location. -Jump maps each edge e ∈ Edg to a predicate Jump(e) of the form φ ∧ φ ∧ i / ∈Update(e) (x i = x i ), where φ ∈ Rect(X) and φ ∈ Rect(X ) and Update(e) ⊆ {1, . . . , n}. The variables in X refer to the updated values of the variables after the edge has been traversed. Each variable x i with i ∈ Update(e) is updated nondeter- ministically to an arbitrary new value in the interval [[φ ]] i . A rectangular automaton is m-bounded if all its rectangular constraints are m- bounded. Definition 21 [Nondecreasing and bounded variables] Let H be a rectangular automa- ton, and let i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. The variable x i of H is nondecreasing if for every control mode ∈ Loc, the invariant interval [[Inv()]] i and the flow interval [[Flow()]] i are subsets of the nonnegative reals. The variable x i is bounded if for every control mode ∈ Loc, the invariant interval [[Inv()]] i is a bounded set.</figDesc></figure>
