				<p>Massively parallel transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) is becoming the method of choice for studying functional effects of genetic variability and establishing causal relationships between genetic variants and disease. However, RNA-Seq poses new technical and computational challenges compared to genome sequencing. In particular, mapping tran-scriptome reads onto the genome is more challenging than mapping genomic reads due to splicing. Furthermore, detection and genotyping of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) requires statistical models that are robust to variability in read coverage due to unequal transcript expression levels. In this paper we present a strategy to more reliably map transcriptome reads by taking advantage of the availability of both the genome reference sequence and transcript databases such as CCDS. We also present a novel Bayesian model for SNV discovery and genotyping based on quality scores, along with experimental results on RNA-Seq data generated from blood cell tissue of a Hapmap individual showing that our methods yield increased accuracy compared to several widely used methods.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the completion of a growing number of individual genomes, including several cancer genomes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> for a recent review). While whole-genome sequencing provides a near-complete catalog of variants and individual genotypes, sequencing of mRNA transcripts (RNA-Seq) is becoming the method of choice for studying functional implications of genetic variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. In particular, RNA sequencing is an important source of information for studying the effect of genetic variation on transcription regulation and establishing causal relationships between mutations and disease. For cancer research, comparison of RNA-Seq data generated from normal tissue and tumor samples can provide the information needed to discover driver mutations or to find new therapy targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Analysis of RNA-Seq data poses several challenging computational problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. First, eukaryotic mRNA transcripts are typically the result of splicing, whereby non-coding regions called introns are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule. This makes the use of tools for mapping of DNA reads to the reference genome like Maq <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> or Bowtie <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> not suitable for finding the genomic location of reads spanning splicing sites. Several methods based on spliced alignment have been proposed to identify splicing sites and assemble full transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, however these methods incur a high computational cost and require very high sequencing depth, typically with paired reads. Even when accurate read mapping is achieved, differences in transcription levels result in unequal sequencing depths of different transcripts, making it difficult to identify variants in regions transcribed at low levels. Although it is possible to overcome this difficulty by sequencing both genomic DNA and mRNA and identifying variants from the genomic DNA reads using standard methods, when the interest is in expressed variants it is significantly more cost effective to identify them directly from mRNA reads <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Our main contributions are an efficient strategy for accurate mapping of mRNA reads and a new method for single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection and genotyping. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> To improve the success rate and accuracy of read mapping, we map mRNA reads against both the reference genome and a transcript library such as the consensus coding sequences (CCDS) database <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> and then combine mapping results using a simple rule set. Our method for SNV detection and genotyping is based on computing, for each locus, conditional probabilities for each of the ten possible genotypes given the reads, and then choosing the genotype with highest posterior probability using Bayes' rule. The underlying prob-abilistic model assumes independence among reads and fully exploits the information provided by base quality scores. Unlike other widely used Bayesian methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, we keep calls for all four possible alleles and do not apply a separate test of heterozygosity.</p><p>We validated our methods on a publicly available Illumina RNA-Seq dataset generated from blood cell tissue of an individual in the CEU population of the International Hapmap project <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, using as gold standard more than three million SNP genotypes available in the Hapmap database. The results indicate that the combined mapping strategy yields improved genotype calling accuracy compared to performing genome or CCDS mapping alone and that our SNV detection and genotyping method is more sensitive than existing methods for equal levels of specificity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Mapping strategy for mRNA reads</head><p>Mapping mRNA reads against the reference genome using standard mapping programs such as Bowtie <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or Maq <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> does not require gene annotations but leaves reads spanning exon junctions unmapped. Spliced alignment methods such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> could theoretically overcome this difficulty but in practice they are computationally intensive and not well suited for very short reads. On the other hand, mapping against a reference transcript library like the Consensus Coding Sequences Database (CCDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> recovers reads spanning known splicing junctions but fails to recover reads coming from unannotated genes.</p><p>We decided to map reads both against the reference genome and the reference transcript library and to implement a custom rule set for merging the two resulting datasets. We implemented two approaches that we called hard merging and soft merging. For hard merging, we require unique alignments against both references and agreement between them while in soft merging we relaxed the uniqueness constraint by requiring a unique alignment to at least one reference and keeping that alignment. For both approaches we keep reads that map uniquely to one reference and do not map to the other one. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table I</ref> summarizes the decision rules applied to each read by each approach, depending on how the read mapped on each reference and on the concordance between the two alignments. One important issue is how to deal with reads aligned to genes with multiple isoforms. After mapping onto the reference transcriptome, multiple alignments can be reported for some reads not because there exist different genomic locations where the read could come from but because the same genomic location is shared by several different transcripts. After mapping against the transcripts database, our module transfers each alignment to absolute genomic coordinates, splicing accordingly if the alignment spans multiple exons, and then checks for each read with multiple alignments if all of them fall into the same </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. SNV detection and genotyping</head><p>To discover expressed SNVs in the sample we experimented with SOAPsnp <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and Maq <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which are two widely used Bayesian methods implemented in the SAMtools package <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We also tried the SNV detection method for mRNA reads called PMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which is based in careful filtering of aligned reads and a binomial test equivalent to setting up a minimum coverage threshold to make a variant call relative to the total locus coverage. The trade-off between sensitivity and specificity of this method is controlled by the maximum p-value required to discard the null hypothesis of absence of a variant allele. In terms of outcome, both SOAPsnp and Maq have the apriori advantage of not just pointing out the loci with variant alleles but also inferring the most likely genotype at each locus. The Bayesian methods also provide for each locus posterior probabilities of having an allele different than the reference and of the genotype itself.</p><p>Our new Bayesian method, named SNVQ, computes for each locus the posterior probability of each of the ten possible genotypes given the reads. For a locus i we let R i denote the set of mapped reads spanning this locus. In all Bayesian methods, the posterior probability of a genotype is calculated from its prior and conditional probabilities by using the Bayes rule,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (G i |R i ) = P (Ri|Gi)P (Gi) P (Ri)</formula><p>. The main difference between models lies in the way conditional probabilities are calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Both Maq and SOAPsnp use a different model to calculate probabilities of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes. Maq uses a binomial distribution on the alleles having the two highest counts while SOAPsnp uses a rank test to determine heterozygosity. SOAPsnp also assumes as prior information that the homozygous reference genotype is the most likely one and calculates conditional probabilities based on Illumina specific knowledge about the reads <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. We decided instead to use a uniform set of assumptions for calculating conditional probabilities of all genotypes. Assuming independence between reads, the conditional probability of genotype G i can be expressed as a product of read contributions, i.e., P (R i |G i ) = r∈Ri P (r|G i ). For a mapped read r ∈ R i let r(i) be the base spanning locus i and ε r(i) be the probability of error sequencing the base r(i), which we estimated from the quality score q(i) calculated during primary analysis using the Phred formula ε r(i) = 10 −q(i)/10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We discarded allele calls with quality scores zero and one.</p><note type="other">Let H i and H i be the two real alleles at locus i, or in other words, let G i = H i H i . The observed base r(i) could be read from either H i or H i .</note><p>If there is an error in this read, we assume that the error can produce any of the other three possible bases with the same probability. Thus, the probability of observing a base r(i) given than the real base is different is ε r(i) /3 while the probability of observing r(i) without error is 1 − ε r(i) .</p><p>If G i is a heterozygous genotype (i.e., H i 񮽙 = H i ) and the observed allele r(i) is equal to H i (H i ) this outcome could be due to two possible events. Either r(i) was sampled without error from the haplotype containing H i (H i ) or r(i) was sampled from the haplotype containing H i (H i ) but an error turned it to be equal to H i (respectively H i ). Assuming that both haplotypes are sampled with equal probability, the first event happens with probability (1 − ε r(i) )/2 while the second happens with probability ε r(i) /6. Using the fact that for homozygous genotypes the probability of observing each possible base does not depend on the haplotype from which the reads are sampled, we obtain the following formula for computing the probability of observing read r for each possible genotype:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (r|G i = H i H i ) =          1 − ε r(i) , if H i = H i = r(i) ε r(i) 3 , if H i 񮽙 = r(i) ∧ H i 񮽙 = r(i) 1 2 − ε r(i) 3</formula><p>, otherwise</p><p>Note that no matter which is the genotype G i , the sum of the probabilities P (r|G i ) over the four possible values of r i is equal to one. We complete the model by setting prior probabilities based on the expected heterozygosity rate h as follows (in all our experiments, we assumed a heterozygosity rate h = 0.001):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (G i = H i H i ) = 1−h 4 , if H i = H i h 6 , otherwise</formula><p>Finally, a variant is called if the genotype with highest posterior probability is different than homozygous reference. In the next section we show a comparison of results among these methods by reanalyzing a publicly available dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Software and performance issues</head><p>We implemented mapped read merging strategies and SNVQ in Java 1.6 and we packed both programs with a In order to enable integration with other analysis tools we use the SAM format <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for both the input and the output of mapped read merging. We also sort alignments by chromosome and absolute position to enable efficient processing in subsequent modules and fast merging of results from different lanes if available. SAM files produced by the merging module can be used directly as input for the SAMtools package <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to produce run statistics, pileup information, and for variants detection. We recommend to run the merging process lane by lane because it needs to load all unique alignments in memory in order to sort them at the end of the process. We used space efficient data structures that allow us to process more than ten million reads in a few minutes, using up to 16Gb of memory. The code implementing SNVQ is able to receive as input either alignments in SAM format or pileup information in the format described in the SAMtools package. The pileup format is recommended because it enables faster processing and reduces the memory requirements. Our experiments indicate that SNVQ is able to process a whole transcriptome pileup file in about 20 minutes using a single processor and up to 4Gb of memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Methods comparison</head><p>We tested the performance of the combined mapping strategies and SNV detection methods on publicly available 33 bp long Illumina mRNA reads generated from blood cell tissue of the Hapmap individual NA12878 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> (NCBI SRA database accession numbers SRX000565 and SRX000566). We used Bowtie <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to map the reads against both the human reference genome (NCBI Build 37.1, downloaded from the UCSC hg19 genome browser database <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>) and the CCDS transcript library <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table II</ref> shows results in terms of reads uniquely mapped using each considered method. Accuracy was determined using as gold standard 3, 371, 552 Hapmap SNP genotype calls for NA12878, including 2, 008, 415 that are homozygous for the reference allele, 802, 472 that are heterozygous and 560, 665 that are homozygous for the non-reference allele.</p><p>To measure accuracy of genotype calling, we defined as true positive a correctly called heterozygous or homozygous non reference SNP and as false positive an incorrectly called homozygous SNP. We did not consider as error a heterozygous SNP called homozygous or not called because this can be due to lack of read coverage for one or both alleles. We consider that one method is more accurate than another when it is able to detect more true positives for the same number of false positives, or conversely if it detects the same number of true positives with fewer false positives.</p><p>To assess the accuracy of various mapping strategies, we ran SNVQ on datasets consisting of reads mapped uniquely onto the CCDS transcript library and onto the reference genome, respectively reads mapped by the hard and soft merging strategies presented in the methods section. Since for reads mapped on transcripts it is only possible to detect SNVs in transcripts included in the CCDS database, we excluded from this comparison all Hapmap SNPs located outside of annotated CCDS exons. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows that our merging strategies produce more accurate results than just genome or transcripts mapping for the NA12878 data. Although in this comparison suggests that genome mapping could be more sensitive than the merging strategies for some specificity levels, we confirmed by repeating the comparison on the full set of Hapmap SNPs that merging methods dominate for all levels of specificity (data not shown). Since the performance of the hard and soft merging strategies is very similar, further results are presented only for the former method. Accuracy comparison among four different SNV detection methods on the Hard Merged reads. A total of 3,371,552 Hapmap SNPs with known genotypes for the individual NA12878 were used as gold standard for comparison. The tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity is controlled in the Bayesian Methods (SNVQ, SOAPsnp, and Maq) by varying the minimum probability of having a genotype different than the reference, while in PMA it is controlled by varying the maximum p-value required to discard the null hypothesis of absence of variants In order to compare Bayesian methods with PMA, we ran all methods on the set of reads aligned by the hard merge method. Since PMA only performs SNV detection, for this comparison we define as true positive a detected heterozygous or homozygous non reference SNP, no matter which is the actual genotype call, and as false positive a homozygous reference SNP marked as having a variant. Thus, calling as heterozygous a homozygous not-reference SNP is considered a true positive for SNV detection, because the variant was detected, but a false positive for genotype calling because an inexistent reference allele is being called. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows that all Bayesian methods have significantly better SNV detection accuracy than PMA and SNVQ is slightly more sensitive than SOAPsnp and Maq at different specificity levels obtained by varying the threshold on the genotype probability reported by each method. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows that the accuracy gain of SNVQ over SOAPsnp and Maq is more pronounced for genotyping accuracy. We confirmed this behavior by running the Bayesian methods on the set of reads mapped uniquely onto the genome reference (data not shown). Our results indicate that the binomial tests of heterozygosity employed by Maq and SOAPsnp result in under-calling true heterozygous loci. These heterozygous loci are found by SNVQ thanks to its unified model based on computing conditional probabilities for every possible genotype. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Accuracy for different expression levels</head><p>In RNA-Seq reads are sampled from transcripts roughly proportionally to their relative expression levels. To assess the effect of expression level on genotyping accuracy we calculated RPKM (Reads per Kilobase per Million Reads) values for every exon in the CCDS database based on the hard merged alignments. For each exon, we counted the number of reads that span it partially or totally and then we normalized the count by dividing it by the size of the exon in kilobases. We finally divided that number by the total number of reads in millions (34.9 for the hard merged dataset). We defined the RPKM value of each heterozygous and homozygous non reference Hapmap SNP in a known exon as equal to the RPKM of the exon to which it belongs. We finally grouped variants into bins according to their RPKM values and computed genotyping accuracy of SOAPsnp, Maq, and SNVq for each bin. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows that, as expected, all methods have poor sensitivity for variants with low RPKM. SNVQ consistently outperforms the other two methods, with most pronounced gains at intermediate coverage depths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we propose several techniques that increase sensitivity of detecting and genotyping expressed sequence variants using RNA-Seq data. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that our methods outperform widely used SNV detection methods, and that transcriptome sequencing can indeed provide a cost effective method for analyzing these variants. In future work we seek to integrate our tools with methods for estimating isoform expression levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and to extend our model by incorporating allele specific expression of isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. We also plan to integrate additional transcript annotation sources such as dbEST and UCSC, and to integrate our methods in a bioinformatics pipeline enabling personalized cancer immunotherapy based on tumor transcriptome sequencing.</p></div>
