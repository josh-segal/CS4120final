				<p>We study the following Bayesian setting: m items are sold to n selfish bidders in m independent second-price auctions. Each bidder has a private valuation function that expresses complex preferences over all subsets of items. Bidders only have beliefs about the valuation functions of the other bidders, in the form of probability distributions. The objective is to allocate the items to the bidders in a way that provides a good approximation to the optimal social welfare value. We show that if bidders have submodular valuation functions, then every Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the resulting game provides a 2-approximation to the optimal social welfare. Moreover, we show that in the full-information game a pure Nash always exists and can be found in time that is polynomial in both m and n.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Combinatorial Auctions. In a combinatorial auction m items M = {1, . . . , m} are offered for sale to n bidders N = {1, . . . , n}. Each bidder i has a valuation function (or valuation, in short) v i that assigns a non-negative real number to every subset of the items. v i expresses i's preferences over bundles of items. The value v i (S) can be thought of as specifying i's maximum willingness to pay for S. Two standard assumptions are made on each v i : v i (∅) = 0 (normalization), and v i (S) ≤ v i (T ) for every two bundles S ⊆ T (monotonicity). The objective is to find a partition of the items among the bidders S 1 , . . . , S n (where S i ∩ S j = ∅ for all i 񮽙 = j) such that the social welfare Σ i v i (S i ) is maximized.</p><p>The interplay between selfishness and computational optimization in combinatorial auctions is well-studied. Each of these aspects alone can be handled in a satisfactory way: The celebrated VCG mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref>] motivate agents to truthfully report their private information, and optimize the social-welfare. The caveat is that this may take exponential time <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> (in the natural parameters of the problem m and n). On the other hand, if we disregard strategic issues, it is possible to obtain good approximations to the optimal social-welfare 񮽙񮽙 Supported by a grant from the Israel Science Foundation.</p><p>in polynomial time, for restricted, yet very expressive special cases of combinatorial auctions (e.g., combinatorial auctions in which bidders have submodular valuations, known as combinatorial auctions with submodular bidders <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>). It is the combination of the two challenges that proves to be problematic.</p><p>Bayesian Combinatorial Auctions. In this paper we approach the problem of handling selfishness and computational hardness from an old-new perspective: Harsanyi <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> introduced Bayesian games as an elegant way of modeling selfishness in partial-information settings. In a Bayesian game, players do not know the private information of the other players, but only have beliefs, expressed by probability distributions over the different possible realizations of this private information. In combinatorial auctions this translates to probability distributions over the possible valuation functions of the other bidders. We are interested in maximizing the social-welfare in a way that is aligned with the interests of the different bidders. We ask the following question: Can we design an auction for which any Bayesian Nash equilibrium provides a good approximation to the optimal social-welfare? This question is, of course, an extension of the well known "price of anarchy" question <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> to Bayesian settings.</p><p>Inspired by eBay, we study the simple auction in which the m items are sold in m independent second-price auctions. This auction induces a game in which a bidder's strategy is the m-dimensional vector of bids he submits in the different single-item auctions, and his payoff is his value for the set of items he is allocated minus his payments. Unfortunately, in this general setting, some unnatural problems may arise: Consider the following simple example: m = 1, n = 2, and the bidders have complete information about each other. Let v 1 (1) = 1 and v 2 (1) = 0. Observe that the optimal social welfare is 1 (assign item 1 to bidder 1). Also observe that if bidder 1 bids 0 and bidder 2 bids 1 then this is a pure Nash equilibrium with a social-welfare value of 0. Therefore, the price of anarchy of this full-information game is infinity.</p><p>In the above scenario, the second bidder bid for (and eventually got) an object he was not interested in possessing. However, such a situation is unlikely to occur in real-life situations, especially if bidders are only partially informed and are therefore more inclined to avoid risks. To handle this, we adopt the well-known assumption in decision theory, that the players (bidders) are expost individually-rational. Informally, ex-post individual-rationality means that bidders play it safe, in the sense that a bidder will never make decisions that might (in some scenario) result in getting a negative payoff.</p><p>Our Results. Our main result is the following: We exhibit an auction (we refer to as a Bayesian auction) in which essentially all items are sold in a second-price auction. We prove that any mixed Nash equilibrium for this auction provides a good approximation to the optimal social welfare.</p><p>Theorem: If bidders are ex-post individually-rational, and have submodular valuation functions, then every (mixed) Bayesian Nash equilibrium of a Bayesian auction provides a 2-approximation to the optimal social welfare.</p><p>A bidder i is said to have a submodular valuation function if for all</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S, T ⊆ M v i (S ∪ T ) + v i (S ∩ T ) ≤ v i (S) + v i (T )</formula><p>. This definition of submodularity is known (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) to be equivalent to the following definition: A valuation function is submodular if for every two bundles S ⊆ T that do not contain an item j it holds that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v i (S ∪ {j}) − v i (S) ≥ v i (T ∪ {j}) − v i (T ).</formula><p>This last inequality has a natural interpretation as it implies that the bidders have decreasing marginal utilities (the marginal value of the item decreases as the number of items a bidder has increases). In fact, our theorem holds even if bidders have fractionally-subadditive valuation functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (defined, and termed XOS, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>), a class of valuation functions that strictly contains all submodular ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>We stress that this "Bayesian price of anarchy" result is independent of the bidders' beliefs. That is, the 2-approximation ratio is guaranteed for any common probability distribution ("common prior") over the valuation functions (we do require the common prior to be the product of independent probability distributions). This suggests a middle-ground between the classical economic and the standard computer science approaches: Works in economics normally assume that the "input" is drawn from some specific probability distribution, and prove results that apply to that specific one. In contrast, computer scientists prefer a worst-case analysis that holds for every possible input. We require the assumption that the input is drawn from some (known) probability distribution but expect to obtain a good approximation ratio regardless of what it is. We note that an approach similar to ours was applied to selfish routing problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> Open Question: Can a (mixed) Bayesian Nash equilibrium be computed in polynomial time?</p><p>Simple examples show that a pure Bayesian Nash is not guaranteed to exist in our Bayesian setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . An interesting special case of the Bayesian game is the full-information game in which every bidder's valuation function is known to all other bidders. We show, that in such full-information games a pure Nash equilibrium always exists. This is true even if the bidders are not ex-post individually rational. In fact, it is easy to show that even the optimal allocation of items can be achieved in a pure Nash equilibrium. So, while the price of anarchy in this game is infinity (without ex-post individual-rationality), the price of stability (the social welfare value of the best Nash equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) is 1. However, optimizing the social-welfare in combinatorial auctions with submodular bidders in known to be NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Therefore, we are left with the following natural question: Can we find a pure Nash equilibrium that provides a good approximation to the optimal social welfare in polynomial time?</p><p>We give the following answer for submodular bidders:</p><p>Theorem: If bidders have submodular valuation functions then a pure Nash equilibrium of the complete-information game that provides a 2-approximation to the optimal social welfare exists and can be computed in polynomial time.</p><p>We prove the theorem by showing that the approximation algorithm for maximizing social welfare in combinatorial auctions with submodular bidders, proposed by Lehmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, can be used to compute the bids in a pure Nash equilibrium.

Unfortunately, while this myopic procedure does compute a pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time for some interesting (nonsubmodular) subcases, this is not true in general. We prove that the myopic procedure may take exponential time by exhibiting a non-trivial construction of an instance on which this can occur.</p><p>Open Question: Can a pure Nash equilibrium that obtains a 2-approximation to the optimal social-welfare be computed in polynomial time if bidders have fractionally-subadditive valuation functions?</p><p>The proofs omitted due to space limitations can be found in the full version of the paper.</p></div>

For all i, let V i denote the finite set of possible valuations of player i. The set of possible valuation profiles of the players is then V = V 1 × . . . × V n . There is a known probability distribution D over the valuations V (a common prior ). D can be regarded as some market statistics that is known to all bidders (and to the auctioneer), and specifies their beliefs.

An n-tuple of bidding-functions B = (B 1 , . . . , B n ) is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium if for every i ∈ [n], and for every valuation function v i , the bid B i (v i ) maximizes i's expected utility given that his valuation function is v i , and that the bid of every other bidder j is B j (v j ), where v j is drawn from D j .

For a fixed valuation profile of the bidders v = (v 1 , . . . , v n ), the optimal social-welfare is OP T (v) = max S1,...,Sn Σ i v i (S i ), where the maximum is taken over all partitions of M into disjoint bundles S 1 , . . . , S n .

Due to ex-post individual-rationality, a bidder will never submit a bid that might result in a negative payoff. Recall that the rules of the auction dictate that it is possible that a bidder get any subset of the items for which he submitted his non-zero bids and be charged the sum of these bids. Hence, a bidder's bid must uphold the following property: Definition 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Bayesian Price of Anarchy of 2</head><p>This subsection exhibits our main result. For ease of exposition we prove the theorem regarding the Bayesian price of anarchy for pure Bayesian Nash equilibria. The (more complicated) proof for mixed Nash is omitted due to space limitations and appears in the full version of the paper. The proof of the theorem exploits the fractional subadditivity of the valuations via the following lemma: Lemma 1. Let S be a set of items, and a i be a maximizing additive valuation of player i for this set, restricted so that a i = 0 on M \S. If i bids according to a i , while all the others bid according to any pure profile b −i , then</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">u i (a i , b −i ) ≥ v i (S) − Bids −i (S, b −i ).</formula><p>Proof. Let X i := X i (a i , b −i ) be the set of items that player i is going to get. Note that if i wins any item j 񮽙 ∈ S then the maximum bid on this j was 0. Thus we can assume w.l.o.g. that X i ⊆ S. Moreover, a i (j) − Bids −i ({j}, b −i ) ≤ 0 holds for every non-obtained item j ∈ S − X i . Therefore, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">u i (a, b −i ) = v i (X i ) − Bids −i (X i , b −i ) ≥ 񮽙 j∈Xi a i (j) − Bids −i (X i , b −i ) ≥ 񮽙 j∈S a i (j) − Bids −i (S, b −i ) = v i (S) − Bids −i (S, b −i ).</formula><p>Theorem 1. Let D be a distribution over fractionally-subadditive valuations of the bidders. If B = (B 1 , . . . , B n ) is a Bayesian Nash, such that each B i maps every valuation function v i to a supporting bid (given v i ) then SW (OP T ) SW (B) ≤ 2.</p><p>Proof. Let v = (v 1 , . . . , v n ) be a fixed valuation profile. We denote by O v = (O v 1 , . . . , O v n ) the optimum allocation with respect to profile v. Now for every player i, let a i denote the maximizing additive valuation for the set O v i , (in particular, a i (j) = 0 if j 񮽙 ∈ O v i ). For all i, we consider a i as an alternative strategy to B i (v i ).</p><p>Let us fix a bidder i. Let w −i be an arbitrary valuation profile of all bidders except for i.

In fact, we also prove that the price of stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is 1, i.e. the optimum can always be achieved in a Nash equilibrium.</p><p>In Subsection 3.2 we show that if bidders have submodular valuation functions then such a pure Nash can be reached in polynomial time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Fractionally-Subadditive Valuation Functions</head><p>Despite the fact that (as shown in the Introduction) some Nash equilibria may fail to provide good approximation to the social-welfare, we present a constructive way for finding a pure Nash that yields a 2-approximation. We introduce a natural procedure we call the Potential Procedure which always reaches such an equilibrium. The Potential Procedure is a simple myopic procedure for fractionally-subadditive bidders 8 .</p><p>For every i let A i = {a i 1 , ..., a i li } be a set of additive valuations such that for every S ⊆ M v i (S) = max a∈Ai a(S). Recall that since v i is fractionally subadditive such A i must exist. Informally, the Potential Procedure simply starts with some arbitrary supporting bids (corresponding to some maximizing additive valuations) and let players best-reply, one by one, to the bids of other players by switching to new supporting bids.</p><p>The Procedure:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">1. Initialize b * i (j) ← 0, S i ← ∅, r j ← 0, for i = 1, .</formula><p>. . , n and j = 1, . . . , m. 2. While there is a bidder i such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">S i 񮽙 = arg max S⊆M (v i (S) − Σ j∈(S\Si) r j ): (a) Let T = arg max S⊆M (v i (S) − Σ j∈(S\Si) r j ). Let a ∈ A i be such that v i (T ) = a(T ). (b) Set b * i (j) ← 0 and r j ← 0 for all j ∈ S i . (c) Set b * i (j) ← a(j) for all j ∈ T . Set r j ← a(j) for all j ∈ T . (d) Set S i ← T . (e) For all k 񮽙 = i set S k ← S k \S i , and set b * k (j) ← 0 for all j ∈ S i . 3. Output b * = (b * 1 , . . . , b * n ).</formula><p>Observe that in the definition we do not require a(j) ≥ r j in lines (a)-(c) (i.e., that r j increase). However, this follows from the fact that T maximizes v i (S) − Σ j∈(S\Si) r j . We use a potential-function argument and the fractionalsubadditivity of the bidders to show that the Potential Procedure eventually converges to a "good" pure Nash.</p><p>Theorem 2. If the valuation functions are fractionally subadditive, then the Potential Procedure converges to a pure Nash equilibrium that provides a 2-approximation to the optimal social-welfare.</p><p>We note that the proof shows that even the optimal social-welfare can be obtained in a pure Nash equilibrium and so the price of stability is 1. So, we have a natural procedure, that is essentially a best response sequence of the players, that leads to a pure Nash equilibrium. But, how long will it take the Potential Procedure to converge? A non-trivial construction shows that unfortunately the worst case running time is exponential in n and m.</p><p>Theorem 3. There is an instance with 2 bidders, each with a fractionallysubadditive valuation function, on which the Potential Procedure converges after Ω(2 m ) steps.</p><p>Theorem 3 leaves us with two interesting open questions: First, will the Potential Procedure converge in polynomial time if the valuation functions are submodular? Second, does the Potential Procedure always run in time that is polynomial in the size of the sets of additive valuations that underlie every fractionally-subadditive valuation? An affirmative answer to this question would imply that the Potential Procedure runs in polynomial time if the bidders have fractionally-subadditive valuations encoded in a bidding language (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>). We note that in the instance in the proof of Theorem 3 the size of the sets of additive valuations was exponential n and m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Submodular Valuation Functions</head><p>In this subsection, we focus on submodular valuation functions. We show that one can find, in polynomial time, a pure Nash equilibrium that also satisfies the premises of Theorem 1. The procedure we present exploits the algorithm due to <ref type="bibr">Lehmann et al. [13]</ref>. This procedure, which we will call the Marginal-Value Procedure, therefore provides a 2-approximation to the optimal social welfare.</p><p>The Procedure:</p><p>1. Fix an arbitrary order on the items. W.l.o.g. let this order be 1, . . . , m. 2. Initialize S i ← ∅, and r j ← 0, for i = 1, . . . , n, and j = 1, . . . , m. 3. For each item j = 1, . . . , m:</p><p>(a) Let i = arg max t∈N v t (S t ∪ {j}) − v t (S t ). Set S i ← S i ∪ {j}.</p><p>(b) Set r j ← max t∈N v t (S t ∪ {j}) − v t (S t ). 4. For every bidder i set b * i (j) ← r j for all j ∈ S i and b * i (j) ← 0 for all j / ∈ S i . 5. Output b * = (b * 1 , ..., b * n ). Observe, that the resulting n-tuple of bid-vectors b * is such that for each item, only one bidder offers a non-zero bid for that item. This is due to the fact that we are dealing with a complete-information setting (intuitively, if a bidder does not win an item he might as well not bid on it). Also notice that the MarginalValue Procedure only requires m rounds and so ends in polynomial time.</p><p>Theorem 4. If the valuation functions are submodular then a pure Nash equilibrium that provides a 2-approximation to the optimal social-welfare can be computed in polynomial time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>w</head><label></label><figDesc>−i∈V−i D(w −i )Bids w−i −i (O v i ), and 񮽙 w∈V D(w)Bids w−i −i (O v i ) are equal, because D is independent for all bidders. Finally, Bids</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> In fact, even a mixed Nash equilibrium is not guaranteed to exist unless one discretizes the strategy space (e.g., only allows bids that are multiples of some small 񮽙 &gt; 0).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> observe that Xi(b) is actually a random variable, but since the event that not all items are sold in second-price auctions only occurs with very low probability we shall often refer to Xi(b) as indicating a specific bundle of items.</note>

			<note place="foot">A simple example shows that even in the full-information setting, this Bayesian price of anarchy result is tight. 3 Computing Pure Nash Equilibria In this section we consider the following full-information game: The m items are sold to n bidders with fractionally-subadditive valuation functions in m independent second-price auctions. The players&apos; valuation functions are assumed to be common knowledge.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> This procedure requires bidder i to be able to determine which bundle he would prefer most, given a vector of per-item payments r = (r1, ..., rm). That is, to declare a bundle S for which vi(S) − Σj∈Srj is maximized. This type of query is called a demand query and is very common in combinatorial auctions literature (see, e.g., [2, 4, 6, 7]).</note>
