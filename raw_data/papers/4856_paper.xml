				<p>Transactional Memory (TM) is a promising technique that addresses the difficulty of parallel programming. Since TM takes responsibility for all concurrency control, TM systems are highly vulnerable to subtle correctness errors. Due to the difficulty of fully proving the correctness of TM systems, many of them are used without any formal correctness guarantees. This paper presents ChkTM, a flexible model checking environment to verify the correctness of various TM systems. ChkTM aims to model TM systems close to the implementation level to reveal as many potential bugs as possible. For example, ChkTM accurately models the version control mechanism in timestamp-based software TMs (STMs). In addition, ChkTM can flexibly model TM systems that use additional hardware components or support nested parallelism. Using ChkTM, we model several TM systems including a widely-used industrial STM (TL2), a hybrid TM (SigTM) that uses hardware signatures, and an STM (NesTM) that supports nested parallel transactions. We then demonstrate how ChkTM can be used to find a previously unreported correctness bug in the current implementation of eager-versioning TL2. We also verify the serializability of TL2 and SigTM and strong isolation guarantees of SigTM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Transactional Memory (TM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has emerged as a promising technique that simplifies parallel programming. TM addresses the difficulty of parallel programming by allowing programmers to simply declare certain code blocks as transactions. TM guarantees that user-defined transactions execute in an atomic and isolated way with respect to other code blocks. Many TM systems have been proposed using hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, software <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, and hybrid techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>TM takes responsibility for managing all accesses to shared state, so extreme attention must be paid to its performance. As a result, subtle but fast implementations are favored over simpler ones, even though that makes the resulting systems difficult to prove correct. TM's central position, however, means that the severity of any bug is magnified.</p><p>To address this problem, a few recent works have attempted to formally verify the correctness of TM systems using model checking techniques. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Cohen et al. proposed a formal method to verify the correctness of TM systems similar to TCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and LogTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> using the TLA+ model checker <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Guerraoui et al.</ref> proved an important reduction theorem that states the verification problem can be reduced to the most general problem with two threads and two shared variables when an evaluated TM system satisfies a set of certain conditions. They then verified the correctness of abstract models of several software TMs (STMs) such as TL2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and DSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Finally, O'Leary et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> verified the correctness of Intel's McRT STM <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> using the Spin model checker <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>However, there still exist research issues that require further investigations. First, TM systems should be modeled close to the implementation level, to reveal as many potential bugs as possible. For example, the TL2 model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> does not model the version control mechanism using timestamps, which requires a hand proof that their abstract model is equivalent to the actual implementation. Second, model checking should be extended to a wide range of TM systems that use additional hardware components (e.g., hybrid TMs) or support nested parallelism. Third, both transactional and non-transactional memory accesses should be modeled to investigate subtle correctness issues with weak isolation and ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Finally, an in-depth, quantitative analysis should be performed to understand practical issues such as the sensitivity of the state space to various system parameters and to motivate further research in model checking TM systems. This paper presents ChkTM, a flexible model checking environment for verifying the correctness of multiple TM systems. ChkTM aims to model TM systems close to the implementation level. For example, the version control mechanism of timestamp-based STMs can be accurately modeled in ChkTM using our timestamp canonicalization technique. Furthermore, ChkTM can flexibly model TM systems that use additional hardware components or support nested parallelism. In addition, transactional and non-transactional memory operations are also modeled in ChkTM.</p><p>The specific contributions of this work are:</p><p>• We propose a flexible model checking environment for TM (ChkTM) that can be used to verify the correctness of various TM systems. ChkTM consists of three components: (1) an architectural state space explorer, (2) TM model specifications, and (3) a test program generator.</p><p>• In ChkTM, we model several TM systems including a widely-used high-performance STM (TL2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a hybrid TM (SigTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> that accelerates an STM using hardware signatures, and an STM (NesTM) that supports nested parallel transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>• We introduce a timestamp canonicalization technique that accurately models the version control mechanism in TL2 and NesTM.</p><p>• We describe a case study in which we actually found a subtle, unreported correctness bug in the current implementation of eager-versioning TL2. We reported this bug to the TL2 developers.</p><p>• Using ChkTM, we verify that TL2 and SigTM guarantee the serializability of every possible execution of every possible program with two threads, each executing one transaction that performs at most three transactional memory operations. We also verify that SigTM provides strong isolation for the test programs described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>• We perform an in-depth, quantitative analysis on ChkTM to understand the practical issues in model checking TM. We first investigate the sensitivity of the state space to system parameters such as the number of concurrent threads. Second, we study the scalability of multithreaded ChkTM to reduce the latency of the verification. Third, we investigate the tradeoff between the performance and correctness of the verification when various approximation techniques are applied to the TM model. Our quantitative analysis also motivates further research on a reduction theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and dynamic partial order reduction techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for verifying TM systems with nested parallelism. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sections II and III review the correctness criteria and the TM systems evaluated in this paper. Section IV describes the design and implementation of ChkTM. Section V presents the main correctness results and an in-depth, quantitative analysis on ChkTM. Section VI reviews related work and Section VII concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CORRECTNESS CRITERIA FOR TM</head><p>Serializability: The main correctness criterion we use in this paper is conflict serializability <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We will discuss how ChkTM verifies the serializability of every possible execution of TM programs in Section IV-A. Strong isolation: A TM system provides strong isolation if transactions are isolated both from other transactions and non-transactional memory accesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Implementing strong isolation in an STM has an unattractive performance impact on all non-transactional code. Although acceptable performance has been reported using whole-program static analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> or dynamic recompilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, few STMs provide strong isolation.</p><p>In contrast, hardware TMs (HTMs) and some hybrid TMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> (including SigTM investigated in this paper) provide strong isolation with low overheads using hardware support. Some STMs provide partial isolation guarantees that can be implemented more efficiently that strong isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Of the TMs we examine in this paper, only SigTM provides any isolation for non-transactional accesses. There is no need to evaluate the partial guarantees for SigTM because it can implement strong isolation efficiently. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 1</ref> presents two violations of strong isolation, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 1</ref>(a) illustrates a non-repeatable read (NR). The expected program behavior is that T1's two reads to x should observe the same value. However, since T2 updates x without using a write barrier, T1 cannot detect the conflict on x. Therefore, the two reads to x may return different values. Both lazy and eager STMs are vulnerable to NR. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 1</ref>(b) illustrates a speculative dirty read (SDR) where a non-transactional read may observe a value speculatively written by a transaction. The expected program outcome is x==1. However, since eager STM speculatively updates shared memory in place on write (i.e., x=1), T2 may observe the value speculatively written by T1 and set y to 2. When T1 re-executes the transaction after it aborts, it will not update x because the value of y has been already updated to 2 by T2. In contrast, lazy STM is invulnerable to SDR because the updates made by a transaction are invisible (i.e., buffered) outside the transaction until it commits. We refer readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for an in-depth discussion on weak isolation behaviors in lazy and eager STMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EVALUATED TM SYSTEMS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. TL2</head><p>Lazy TL2: This STM maintains a software write buffer to perform lazy versioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It uses a global version clock to establish serializability. Using a hashing function, each memory object is associated with a version-owner lock (voLock) that either acts as a lock or stores a version number that indicates the value of global version clock at the time when the memory object was written by a committing transaction. When a transaction reads a memory object, it first checks its write buffer. If not found in the write buffer, it checks the version number in the associated voLock to check any conflict. If no conflict is detected, the address of the memory object is inserted in the read set of the transaction. When a transaction writes to a memory object, it buffers the update into its write buffer. On commit, a transaction performs the following two steps: (1) acquiring all the voLocks for the memory objects in its write set and (2) validating all the memory objects in its read set. If any of the two steps fails, the transaction aborts. Otherwise, the transaction writes back the buffered updates, increments the version number in the acquired voLocks, and finally releases the voLocks. Lazy TL2 and all other STMs evaluated in this paper (i.e., eager TL2 and NesTM) provide weak isolation of transactions. Eager TL2: In contrast to lazy TL2, eager TL2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> maintains a software undo log to perform eager (in place) versioning. The read barrier is similar to the one in lazy TL2, but does not need to check the write buffer. When a transaction writes to a memory object, it attempts to acquire the associated voLock. If this acquisition fails, the transaction aborts. Otherwise, the transaction updates the memory object in place and inserts the previous value into its undo log. On commit, a transaction validates all the memory objects in its read set. If it fails, the transaction aborts by rolling back the speculatively written memory objects and releasing the acquired voLocks. Otherwise, the transaction increments the version number in the acquired voLocks and releases them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. NesTM</head><p>NesTM extends eager TL2 to support closed-nested parallel transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Following the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, NesTM allows a transaction to execute only when it does not have any active children (i.e., a transaction cannot concurrently run with its children). In contrast to eager TL2, voLocks in NesTM are extended to encode the version and ownership information at the same time.</p><p>When a transaction reads a memory object, it checks the owner of the memory object. If the owner is not itself or its ancestor, the transaction aborts. Otherwise it checks the version number to check any conflict. When a transaction writes to a memory object, it attempts to acquire the associated voLock only when the owner of the memory object is itself or its ancestor. If the voLock acquisition fails, the transaction aborts. Once the transaction acquires the voLock, it validates its ancestors. If this validation fails, the transaction aborts. Otherwise, the transaction updates the memory object in place. On commit, a transaction validates all the memory objects in its read set. If this validation fails, the transaction aborts by restoring the values of memory objects and associated voLocks in its write set to the previously observed values. Otherwise, the transaction successfully commits by incrementing version number in the acquired voLocks and transferring ownership of the memory objects to its parent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. SigTM</head><p>Lazy SigTM: This hybrid TM accelerates a lazy-versioning STM using hardware signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Hardware signatures conservatively represent the read and write sets of transactions. In addition, hardware signatures continuously snoop the coherence messages to provide conflict detection and strong isolation. Lazy SigTM uses a software write buffer to perform lazy versioning. Read and write barriers in lazy SigTM operate similarly to the ones in lazy TL2, except that software read and write sets are replaced with hardware signatures. On commit, a transaction performs write-set validation by acquiring exclusive ownership of the cache lines holding the memory objects in its write buffer. If the write-set validation fails, the transaction aborts. Otherwise, the transaction successfully commits by writing back all the buffered updates. Eager SigTM: In contrast to lazy SigTM, eager SigTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> uses a software undo log to perform eager versioning. The read barrier simply inserts the address into the read signature and reads the memory value. The write barrier immediately attempts to acquire exclusive ownership of the cache line holding the memory object. If this acquisition fails, the transaction aborts. Otherwise, it updates the memory object in place and inserts the previous value into its undo log. On commit, the transaction simply resets hardware signatures. Like lazy SigTM, eager SigTM provides strong isolation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> presents the overall architecture of ChkTM that consists of the following three components: (1) an architectural state space explorer, (2) TM model specifications, and (3) a test program generator. All the components are implemented in the Scala programming language <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We decided to use Scala because its domain-specific language features allowed us to implement ChkTM in a very concise way. We will discuss the three components of ChkTM in a bottom-up approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CHKTM</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Architectural State Space Explorer</head><p>As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, the architectural state space explorer (ASE) consists of two main components: (1) an architectural simulator and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>   of a simple shared memory multiprocessor system consisting of processors, store buffers, and shared global memory. Each processor in the simulator models a RISC processor with an ALU, a program counter, a register file, a register checkpoint, and a return stack. Every update to shared memory is made via a bounded store buffer (SB) that may retire stores in any order, which provides a memory consistency model similar to SPARC's Total Store Order (TSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. An explicit memory fence instruction and a compare-and-swap instruction cause SB flushes. When the SB size is set to 0, the simulator models sequential consistency. We use only sequential consistency in this work and leave the verification of TM systems under relaxed consistency models as future work. Finally, all the system parameters such as the number of processors and shared memory size are fully configurable.</p><p>The second component of ASE is the state space explorer. In the state space explorer, states are represented as persistent trees, and state transitions are pure functions that produce a new state without altering the old. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> illustrates how the state space explorer performs a breadth-first search (BFS) 1 to determine all the possible final outcomes when executing a small program using a TM model.</p><p>To reduce the state space, we implemented a simple optimization in which instructions are merged with their successor if the instruction's dynamic execution reads and writes to only processor-private values. Since these intermediate values cannot affect the outcome, this optimization does not affect the correctness of model checking.</p><p>To verify the serializability of a TM system, ChkTM first performs coarse-grain state space exploration (CSE) where only a single processor is active at any time and where the active processor cannot be changed while a transaction is active. CSE directly enumerates all serial schedules. The terminal states produced by CSE are used as valid terminal states. We augment the architectural state to record the values observed by transactional reads (VOR) and the values overwritten by transactional writes (VOW). VOR and VOW are retained only <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Since the state space explorer is based on BFS, it is highly parallelizable. To implement the multi-threaded state space explorer, we parallelized the main loop (i.e., line 5 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>) by dynamically assigning a chunk of iterations to each thread at a time. We quantify its scalability in Section V.</p><p>Assume that initially x==y==0</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>// T1</head><p>// T2 atomic { atomic { ld x st x,200 st y,101 } ld y } VOR(T1)={(x,0)} VOR(T2)={(y,101)} x=200, y=101 VOR(T1)={(x,200)} VOR(T2)={(y,0)} x=200, y=101 T1: ld x T2: st x,200 T2: ld y T1: st y,101 VOR(T1)={(x,0)} VOR(T2)={(y,0)} x=200, y=101 for committed transactions. In addition, ChkTM ensures that every store in a test program writes a unique value. This establishes one-to-one mapping between values recorded in VOR and VOW, and the conflicting read or write operations. After CSE is performed, ChkTM records the VOR, VOW, and final memory state corresponding to every serial execution. These are the valid terminal states. Next, ChkTM performs fine-grain state space exploration (FSE) which explores every possible memory access interleaving. When a terminal state is reached during FSE, ChkTM checks that the VOR, VOW, and final memory state of the terminal state are identical to one of the valid terminal states produced by CSE. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> illustrates how ChkTM detects a serializability violation using VOR and final memory state. A serializability test using only the VOR and final memory state guarantees view serializability. To enforce conflict serializability, we add VOW. The key observation behind using VOW is that any view serializable, but not conflict serializable schedule contains a blind write <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. VOW allows us to check that the ordering of all the write operations of a terminal state reached during FSE is identical to the one produced by a serial execution in CSE. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates an example of how ChkTM detects a conflict serializability violation (but still view serializable) of an execution using VOW. Finally, similar to the serializability verification, ChkTM checks strong isolation as follows. Given a test program, ChkTM produces all the possible expected outcomes discussed in Section II by performing CSE. ChkTM then performs FSE to explore every possible execution of the test program. If any unexpected outcome is detected during FSE, ChkTM reports a strong isolation violation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. TM Model Specifications</head><p>1) Modeling TL2: To model TL2, the baseline ASE is augmented with additional state variables including a global version clock, voLocks, read and write sets of transactions. Global version clock and voLocks are modeled as globally visible variables because they are accessed by multiple processors in the system. In contrast, read and write sets of each transaction are modeled as processor-private variables.</p><p>Then, the algorithms of lazy and eager TL2 are specified using a domain-specific language embedded in Scala. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> compares the C language-styled pseudocode and the model specified in Scala for TxLoad in lazy TL2. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> clearly demonstrates that ChkTM aims to model an evaluated TM system at the implementation level to reveal as many potential bugs as possible. Other TM barriers are also modeled similarly.</p><p>As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, it is challenging to accurately model timestamp-based STMs including TL2. This is because an infinite number of states correspond to serializable executions with different timestamp values. To address the state space explosion problem, we introduce timestamp canonicalization.</p><p>The key observation behind this technique is that the relative ordering among timestamp values is important to order transactional events, but the exact timestamp values are unimportant. In this spirit, after each step, ChkTM canonicalizes all  timestamps that are present anywhere in the architectural state. There are three steps: (1) compute the set of timestamp values present anywhere in the architectural state, (2) sort them, and (3) replace each value with its ordinal position in the sorted set. The canonicalized variables are global version clock (GC), voLocks, and any registers that are holding a timestamp value. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> gives an example. Note that the least significant digit (in decimal) of voLock and VX register values is not canonicalized because it encodes the ownership information.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2 GC vo[0] vo[1] m[0] m[1] vx[0] vx[1</formula><p>2) Modeling NesTM: In addition to the state variables introduced to model TL2, the NesTM model uses additional state variables including a doomed bit, a rollback counter, and a commit lock per each processor. Furthermore, additional instructions such as fork and join are provided to initiate and terminate the execution of nested threads. Unlike (nonnested) TL2, the read and write sets of each processor are also modeled as globally visible variables because they can be accessed by child transactions running on different processors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Finally, since the rollback counter may also cause a state space explosion, ChkTM performs rollback-counter canonicalization, in addition to timestamp canonicalization.</p><p>3) Modeling SigTM: To model SigTM, the baseline ASE is augmented with additional state variables to represent perprocessor hardware signatures (and their state information such as lookUp and WSigNack), and transactional state information such as a doomed bit. All of them are modeled as globally visible state variables because they can be accessed by other processors. Unlike TL2 and NesTM, timestamp variables are unnecessary to model SigTM. Additional memory operations are also modeled including fetchExclusive and non-transactional load and store instructions.</p><p>Currently, ChkTM models SigTM using a zero-latency interconnection network. We expect that prior work on model checking cache coherence protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> can be used to extend the current hardware model in ChkTM. We leave this as future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Test Program Generator</head><p>To verify the serializability of TM systems, the test program generator of ChkTM uses the skeleton code shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. A transaction executes a specified number of transactional memory operations. For each memory operation, there are three parameters to consider: (1) whether it is performed or not, (2) the type of memory operation (i.e., read or write), and (3) the accessed memory location. All these parameters can be generated either randomly (for random tests) or systematically (for exhaustive, complete tests). Also note that the value written by each write operation is unique with respect to all other written values. Finally, to verify the strong isolation guarantees of TM, we manually coded each problematic scenario described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Case Study: Invalid-read Problem</head><p>To showcase ChkTM's effectiveness, we present a case study in which we found an unreported invalid-read bug in the available implementation of eager TL2. To verify the correctness of eager TL2, we modeled it and performed exhaustive tests using ChkTM. During the tests, ChkTM reported a serializability violation with the test program in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> and generated problematic executions including the one shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref>.</p><p>To investigate the cause of the problem, we analyze the invalid execution in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref>. T1 executes the code in TxLoad, while T2 executes the code in TxStore and TxAbort. At step 0, T1 samples the current value of the voLock for addr which is the address of y. At steps 1 and 2, T2 acquires  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 11</ref>: A bug (in line 6) found in TxAbort in eager TL2.</p><p>the voLock and writes a value of 2 to addr during the execution of TxStore. At step 3, T1 reads the speculatively written (i.e., 2) value from addr. At steps 4 and 5, during the execution of TxAbort, T2 restores the memory and voLock values for addr to the previously observed values. At step 6, the if statement tests whether the value of the voLock read at step 0 matches the current value of the voLock (i.e., cv!=getVo(addr)?). Since T2 has already restored the value of voLock to the previous value (i.e., the same value as cv), the test at step 6 fails (i.e., cv==getVo(addr)). Therefore, T1 assumes the memory value read at step 3 is still valid and successfully commits in the end. This is an execution scenario in which the invalid outcome in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> is produced. By analyzing the invalid execution, we identified that there is a subtle correctness bug in line 6 in TxAbort's code shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 11</ref>. To avoid the invalid-read problem, an aborting transaction must increment the timestamp values of the acquired voLocks instead of merely restoring them to the previous values. We reported this bug to the TL2 developers.</p><p>In addition, readers should note that it may be very difficult to find this kind of subtle bugs by performing random tests using the implemented TM code on real machines. One can increase the possibility of revealing such bugs from random tests by inserting randomized delays at various locations in the TM code (e.g., between the operations at steps 0 and 3 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref>). However, it requires programmer's non-trivial intuitions on where potential bugs would be. In contrast, ChkTM can reveal any potential bug without requiring programmer's intuitions because it explores every possible execution of a TM program, even unlikely ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Discussion</head><p>State space reduction: While we implemented a simple optimization that merges locally visible steps to reduce the state space in ChkTM, it is an interesting, open question to implement more aggressive optimizations, such as partial  order reduction (POR) techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, traditional POR techniques cannot be directly applied due to their conservativeness when iterations or global variables are used in the TM model. In particular, we note that it will be interesting to extend dynamic POR techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>  Verifying liveness: ChkTM could be extended to verify the liveness of TM systems by detecting cycles in the state transition graph. The existence of a cycle indicates that there is an execution scenario in which a TM program can never terminate (e.g., transactions infinitely abort and restart). Note that all the evaluated TM systems in this paper are known to admit livelock, but attempt to probabilistically provide liveness using randomized backoff schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we first discuss our main correctness results for TL2 and SigTM, and describe our progress in verifying NesTM. We then present an in-depth, quantitative analysis on ChkTM to understand the practical issues in model checking TM systems. More specifically, we investigate (1) the sensitivity of the execution time and the number of the explored states to the parameters such as test program size and number of threads, (2) the scalability of the multi-threaded ChkTM, and (3) the tradeoff between the performance and correctness of the verification when approximation techniques are applied to the TM model.</p><p>We performed experiments on computers with two quadcore 2.33GHz Intel R Xeon R CPUs and 32GB of shared memory. We used Linux x86_64 kernel 2.6.18 and the 64-bit Server VM in Sun's Java TM SE Runtime Environment, build 1.6.0-14-b08. We used an 8GB heap for model checking TL2 and SigTM and a 30GB heap for model checking NesTM. Finally, we used the Scala compiler version 2.7.5 to compile the ChkTM code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Correctness Results</head><p>Serializability: To verify the serializability of TL2 and SigTM, we first generated all the possible test programs that satisfy the following conditions 2 : (1) two threads in each program, (2) one transaction per thread, (3) at most three transactional memory operations (i.e., read or write) per transaction, (4) no non-transactional memory operations in the program (i.e., purely transactional). In addition, we assumed that the underlying system has two shared memory words and provides sequential consistency. We then ran all the generated test programs on the TL2 and SigTM models in ChkTM and verified that no errors were reported. Therefore, we make the following statement:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Anomaly TL2-L TL2-E SigTM-L SigTM-E NR Y Y N N ILU Y Y N N IDR N Y N N SLU N Y N N SDR N Y N N OW Y N N N BW Y N N N</formula><p>TL2 and SigTM (both lazy and eager) guarantee the serializability of every possible execution of every possible program that runs two threads, each of which executes one transaction that performs no more than three transactional memory operations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table I</ref> summarizes the execution time and number of explored states required to verify each TM system. It takes less than a second to run each test and 2-4 hours to exhaustively verify each TM system with all the possible test programs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table I</ref> shows that the explored state space in verifying lazy TL2 is smaller than the ones with SigTM. Since read sets and write buffers of lazy TL2 can be modeled as processorprivate variables, our optimization that merges locally visible steps is effective in reducing the state space. In contrast, it is less effective for SigTM because read and write signatures in SigTM are modeled as globally visible variables. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table I</ref> also demonstrates that the explored state space in model checking eager TL2 is significantly larger than other TM systems. Since the timestamp values are incremented even when a transaction aborts to avoid the invalid-read problem, more unique states associated with the incremented timestamp values are generated and explored in verifying eager TL2. Strong isolation: To investigate the strong isolation guarantees of TL2 and SigTM, we manually coded the test programs presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. We tested seven of the nine anomalies, including non-repeatable reads (NR), intermediate lost updates (ILU), intermediate dirty reads (IDR), speculative lost updates (SLU), speculative dirty reads (SDR), overlapped writes (OW), and buffered writes (BW). We omitted granularity-related anomalies as they can only be solved at a level higher than a word-based STM. Table II summarizes the results. For every possible execution of all the test programs, SigTM (both lazy and eager) did not produce any unexpected final outcome. In contrast, ChkTM successfully detected weak isolation anomalies for TL2. In summary, we were able to mechanically verify the arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> using the memory operations (both transactional and non-transactional) modeled in ChkTM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Quantitative Analysis</head><p>Sensitivity to the system parameters: We investigate the sensitivity of the execution time and number of explored states in verifying TM to various system parameters. The parameters on which we focus are program and shared memory sizes, and number of threads. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> illustrates the results for the program and shared memory sizes. Program size represents the number of memory operations performed by each transaction. Shared memory size denotes the number of shared memory words in the system. The first result data set is collected by just scaling the program size while the shared memory size is fixed at two (i.e., two shared memory words in the system). In contrast, the second result data set is collected by incrementing the shared memory size by 1 when the program size is incremented by 2. In the baseline configuration, program and shared memory sizes are set to 2. All the results are normalized to the baseline result. Finally, the result at each configuration is collected by running 100 randomly generated test programs on the lazy TL2 model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows that the execution time and number of states increase rather slowly when only the program size increases. With a small shared memory size, each operation conflicts with other operations with a high probability. This limits the number of possible interleavings as each operation has dependencies with other operations due to the conflicts. Therefore, the state space grows relatively marginally even when each transaction performs more operations. In contrast, with a larger shared memory size, each operation can execute more independently with respect to other operations due to lower contention. Therefore, more interleavings can be produced and the state space grows much faster when both program and shared memory sizes increase.</p><p>We also investigate the sensitivity of the execution time and number of states to the number and configuration of threads when checking NesTM. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> presents the sensitivity results to different number and configuration of threads. Specifically, C1 is the configuration in which two top-level transactions (T1 and T2) run. C2 is generated by adding T1.1 (a child of T1) to C1. C3 is generated by adding T1.2 (a child of T1 and sibling of T1.1) to C2. C4 and C5 are repeatedly generated in a similar manner. Each transaction executes only two reads, to reduce the state space. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> shows that the execution time and number of states required to verify NesTM increases explosively when the number of threads rises (note that y-axis in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> has a log scale). One interesting observation is that the increase is largest when a new sibling thread is added (e.g., from C2 to C3, from C4 to C5). This is due to the fact that there is no ordering dependency between sibling transactions, thus more interleavings can be produced. In contrast, when a new (single) child thread is added (e.g., from C1 to C2, from C3 to C4), the increase is relatively smaller. This is because the newly added child has an ordering dependency with its parent, thus the number of possible interleavings is limited. For instance, T1.1 can run only after T1 forks it, and T1 is suspended while T1.1 is active.</p><p>The result in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> clearly motivates the need for a reduction theorem applicable to nested parallel TM. While two threads and two variables are proved sufficient for nonnested TM in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, no such guarantee of completeness is available for our checks of NesTM. Since the state space explosively grows with the increasing number of threads and nesting levels, model checking may be feasible only for small configurations. For example, when larger test programs are used with the thread configuration C5, it is currently not possible to verify NesTM using ChkTM even on computers with 32GB physical memory due to a state space explosion. Finally, dynamic state space reduction techniques should be also investigated to make it feasible to model check the nested TM systems on commodity machines. Scalability of the multi-threaded ChkTM: To investigate the scalability of the multi-threaded ChkTM, we use a test program with the thread configuration C5 on the NesTM model. To avoid a state space explosion, each transaction in the test program performs only two reads. We varied the number of concurrent threads from 1 to 8, and measured the speedup by dividing the execution time with multiple threads by the one with 1 thread. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 14</ref>, the multi-threaded   ChkTM shows reasonable scalability when model checking NesTM (e.g., speedup of 3.5× with 8 threads).</p><p>Tradeoff between performance and correctness: One commonly-used technique to reduce the state space is to apply approximations by merging several steps of the modeled algorithm into one. Obviously, a careless use of such approximations may affect the correctness of the verification. To investigate the tradeoff between the performance and correctness of the verification, we apply a set of approximations when verifying NesTM. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table III summarizes such approximations.</ref> For example, Approximation 1 merges the steps of reading the voLock and the value of a memory object (i.e., the operations at step 0 and 3 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref> are assumed to happen atomically). For another example, Approximation 2 releases all the acquired voLocks on commit in a single step (i.e., the loop is atomically executed). <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table IV</ref> summarizes the average execution time and the number of explored states for verifying the baseline and approximated NesTM models. The results were collected using 10 randomly generated test programs in which the thread configuration C3 is used and each transaction executes at most two memory operations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table IV</ref> shows that Approximation 2 is effective in reducing the state space. On commit, a transaction tends to have more entries in its write set because it has executed all of its memory operations. Therefore, Approximation 2 can effectively reduce the state space by merging more steps in the algorithm. In contrast, approximations applied to the abort barrier are not as effective. On abort, a transaction tends to have less entries in its write set because it often fails to execute all of its memory operations. Therefore the approximations applied to the abort barrier are less effective as they merge fewer steps. In summary, Approximation 6 (all the approximations except for Approximation 1) reduces the   <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table IV</ref> also summarizes the fidelity of the baseline and approximated NesTM models when the invalid-read bug discussed in Section IV-D is intentionally injected. With the injected bug, the model with Approximation 1 does not report an error (i.e., false negative). This is because merging the aforementioned steps makes it impossible to produce any invalid execution similar to the one shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref>. To our surprise, other approximated models do not show any false negative (at least for the invalid-read bug with a set of test programs we used). If it can be proven that a particular approximation does not affect the correctness of model checking, it can be used as an effective tool to reduce the state space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. RELATED WORK</head><p>While there is a large amount of previous work on TM, relatively little work has been done on formally verifying TM systems. Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed a formal method to verify the correctness of a few TM systems similar to TCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and LogTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> using the TLA+ model checker <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Guerraoui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proved an important reduction theorem that states the TM verification problem can be reduced to the most general problem with two threads and two shared variables, when an evaluated TM satisfies a set of certain conditions. In addition, they verified the correctness of abstract models of several STMs including DSTM and TL2. While insightful, these prior theoretical works modeled the evaluated TM systems rather abstractly. For example, the TL2 model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> does not model the version control mechanism using timestamps, which requires a hand proof that their abstract model is equivalent to the actual implementation. In contrast, ChkTM aims to model the evaluated TM systems close to the implementation level, to aggressively find potential bugs.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, O'Leary et al. verified the correctness of Intel's McRT STM using the Spin model checker <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Our work is similar to theirs in the sense that both works attempt to model TM systems at the implementation level. Our work, however, significantly differs in the following three aspects. First, we extend the use cases of model checking TM by investigating a wider range of TM systems, including an industrial, highperformance STM (TL2), a hybrid TM (SigTM) that uses hardware signatures, and an STM (NesTM) that supports nested parallel transactions. Second, ChkTM models both transactional and non-transactional memory operations to enable our study on subtle correctness issues with weak isolation and ordering. Finally, we provide an in-depth, quantitative analysis on ChkTM to understand the practical issues and motivate further research in model checking TM systems.</p><p>Finally, Manovit et al. proposed an axiomatic formulation to model the formal specification of a TM system and used it with random testing to find bugs in the evaluated TM system <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Our work differs in the sense that ChkTM aims to formally verify the correctness of TM systems by model checking all possible executions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper presents ChkTM, a flexible model checking environment for verifying the correctness of various TM systems. ChkTM aims to model TM systems at the implementation level to reveal as many potential bugs as possible. Using ChkTM, we found a subtle, unreported correctness bug in the current implementation of eager TL2. We also verified the serializability of TL2 and SigTM and strong isolation guarantees of SigTM. We quantitatively analyzed ChkTM to understand the practical issues in model checking TM systems. Finally, our quantitative study motivates further research such as investigating a reduction theorem and dynamic partial order reduction techniques for verifying TM systems with nested parallelism without causing a state space explosion.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2: The overall architecture of ChkTM.</figDesc></figure>
