				<p>We investigate the complexity of performing updates on probabilistic XML data for various classes of probabilistic XML documents of different succinctness. We consider two elementary kinds of updates, insertions and deletions, that are defined with the help of a locator query that specifies the nodes where the update is to be performed. For insertions, two semantics are considered, depending on whether a node is to be inserted once or for every match of the query. We first discuss deterministic updates over probabilistic XML, and then extend the algorithms and complexity bounds to prob-abilistic updates. In addition to a number of intractability results, our main result is an efficient algorithm for insertions defined with branching-free queries over probabilistic models with local dependencies. Finally, we discuss the problem of updating probabilistic XML databases with continuous probability distributions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DETERMINISTIC DATA AND QUERIES</head><p>We assume a countable set of identifiers I and one of labels L, such that I ∩ L = ∅. A document is a pair d = (t, θ), where t is a finite, unordered tree over identifiers and θ is a function that maps each node v to a label θ(v) ∈ L. Ignoring the ordering of the children of nodes is a common simplification over the XML model that does not significantly change the results of this paper. We use the standard notions child and parent, descendant and ancestor, root and leaf in the usual way. We denote the root of d by root(d). Two documents d1 and d2 are isomorphic, denoted by d1 ∼ d2, if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nodes of the two documents that preserves labels and edges. Example 1. Consider the document d from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, reproduced in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Identifiers appear inside square brackets before labels. The document describes the personnel of an IT department and the bonuses distributed for different projects. The document d indicates John worked under two projects (laptop and pda) and got bonuses of 37 and 50 in the former project and 50 in the latter one.</p><p>We introduce tree-pattern queries with joins, with join-free queries and single-path queries as special cases. Let Var be a countable set of variables. A tree pattern (with joins), denoted Q, is a tree with two types of edges: child-edges, denoted E / , and descendant edges, denoted E // . The nodes of the tree are labeled by a labeling function λ with either labels from L or with variables from Var. Variables that occur more than once are called join variables. We refer to nodes of Q as n, m in order to distinguish them from the nodes of documents.</p><p>A tree-pattern query with joins has the form Q[¯ n], where Q is a tree pattern with joins and ¯ n is a tuple of nodes of Q (defining its output). We sometimes identify the query with the pattern and write Q instead of Q[¯ n] if ¯ n is not important or clear from the context. If ¯ n is the empty tuple, we say that the query is Boolean. A query is join-free if every variable in its pattern occurs only once. If the set of edges E / ∪ E // of a query is a linear order of the nodes, the query is a single-path query. We denote the set of all tree pattern queries, which may have joins, as TPJ. The subclasses of join-free and single path queries are denoted as TP and SP, respectively.</p><p>A valuation γ maps query nodes to document nodes. A document satisfies a query if there exists a satisfying valuation, or a match, mapping query nodes to document nodes in a way that is consistent with edge types, labeling, and variable occurrences. More precisely, (1) nodes connected by child/descendant edges are mapped to nodes that are children/descendants of each other; (2) query nodes with label a are mapped to document nodes with label a; (3) two query nodes with the same variable are mapped to document nodes with the same label. Let q be a TPJ query and d be a document, then Val(q, d) denotes the set of all valuations γ of q in d. Details of query semantics are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PROBABILISTIC XML</head><p>A finite probability space over documents, px-space for short, is a pair S = (D, Pr), where D is a finite set of nonisomorphic documents and Pr maps each document to a probability Pr(d) with Σ{Pr(d) | d ∈ D} = 1. p-Documents: Syntax. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we now introduce a very general syntax for representing compactly px-spaces, called p-documents. A p-document is similar to a document, with the difference that it has two types of nodes: ordinary and distributional. Distributional nodes are only used for defining the probabilistic process that generates random documents (but they do not actually occur in these ones). Ordinary nodes have labels and they may appear in random documents. We require the leaves and the root to be ordinary nodes.</p><p>Formally, we assume given a set X of Boolean random variables with some specified probability distribution ∆ over X . A p-document, denoted P, is an unranked, unordered, labeled tree. Each node has a unique identifier v and a label µ(v) in</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L ∪ {fie(E)} ∪ {cie(E)} ∪ {exp(Pr)} ∪ {mux(Pr)} ∪ {det}</formula><p>where L are labels of ordinary nodes, and the others are labels of distributional nodes. We consider different kinds of these distributional labels: fie(E) (for formulas of independent events), cie(E) (for conjunction of independent events), exp(Pr) (for explicit), mux(Pr) (for mutually exclusive), and det (for deterministic). If a node v is labeled with (i) fie(E), then E is a function that assigns to each child of v a propositional formula ϕ of events from X ; (ii) cie(E), then E assigns to each child of v a conjunction e1 ∧ · · · ∧ e k of event literals (x or ¬x, for x ∈ X ); (iii) exp(Pr), then Pr assigns to each subset of children of v a probability, summing up to 1; (iv) mux(Pr), then Pr assigns to each child of v a probability,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x &amp; z [25]</formula><p>[56]</p><p>[8]</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x [11] z −z &amp; x [13] [52]</formula><p>[41] 0.7</p><p>[55]</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">0.3 −x [23]</formula><p>[32]</p><p>[54] <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> [21] cie <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>   summing up to 1.</p><p>We denote classes of p-documents by PrXML with a superscript denoting the types of distributional nodes allowed for the p-documents in the class. For instance, p-documents of PrXML mux,det,cie are with mux, det, cie nodes like in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>p-Documents: Semantics. The semantics of a p-document P, denoted by P, is a px-space over random documents, where the documents are denoted by P and are obtainable from P by a randomized three-step process.</p><p>1. We choose a valuation ν of the variables in X . The probability of the choice, according to the distribution ∆,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">is pν = x in P,ν(x)=true ∆(x) · x in P,ν(x)=false (1 − ∆(x)). 2.</formula><p>We delete the children v of each fie(E) or cie(E) node where ν(E(v)) is false, and their descendants. Independently for each exp(Pr) (resp., mux(Pr)) node v, we select a subset of its children V (resp., one of its children v ) according to the corresponding probability distribution Pr and delete the other children and their descendants, the probability of the choice being Pr(V ) (resp., Pr(v )).</p><p>We do not delete any of the children of det nodes. 3. We then remove in turn each distributional node, connecting each ordinary child v of a deleted distributional node with its lowest ordinary ancestor v , or, if no such v exists, we turn this child into a root. The result of this third step is a random document P. The probability Pr(P) is defined as the product of pν , the probability of the variable assignment we chose in the first step, with all Pr(V ) and Pr(v ), the probabilities of the choices that we made in the second step for the exp and mux nodes.</p><p>In addition to the five kinds of distributional nodes presented above (all of which except fie from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>), we occasionally consider ind(Pr) nodes, also from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which specify independent probabilities for every child of a node. As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, ind can be simulated with mux and det. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. It has cie, mux and det distributional nodes. For example, node n21 has label cie(E) and two children n22 and n 24 , such that E(n22) = ¬x and E(n 24 ) = x. Node n11 has label mux(Pr) and two children n8 and n13, such that Pr(n8) = 0.7 and Pr(n13) = 0.3. Document d in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is in P, and corresponds to the assignment x true, z true, and to the choice of John under the mux node. If Pr(x) = 1/2,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Example 2.

Expressiveness. We are interested in complete representation systems: a probabilistic XML model is complete if every px-space can be modeled. It has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that both PrXML ind and PrXML mux are incomplete, whereas PrXML mux,det , PrXML exp and PrXML cie are complete. The PrXML fie model, as a generalization of PrXML cie , is clearly also complete. Our study will focus on these complete representation systems.</p><p>Succinctness. It is also important to understand which models can be seen as particular cases of other models or, in other words, if a p-document of a given class can tractably be transformed into an equivalent p-document of another class. This is of help to prove complexity results about the tractability of updates. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> summarizes the polynomialtime translation between different classes of probabilistic documents. As shown in the picture, it is open whether PrXML exp is polynomially translatable to PrXML mux,det or to PrXML cie . Apart from this, the figure is complete, meaning that the absence of a path between models means there is no efficient translation between them. All the results, except the ones involving PrXML fie , were proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Tractable translation from PrXML cie to PrXML fie is clear since the latter is a generalization of the former. The following proposition shows that PrXML fie is exponentially more succinct than PrXML exp .</p><p>Proposition 3. There is a polynomial-time translation from p-documents of PrXML exp to equivalent p-documents of PrXML fie , but not the other way around.</p><p>Proof. (Sketch) A translation from PrXML exp to PrXML fie is illustrated on an example document in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, and can be generalized in a straightforward way. The other direction is clear since there is no efficient translation from PrXML cie to PrXML exp <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>It is actually possible (but slightly more involved) to show PrXML fie is exponentially more succinct than PrXML exp,cie , which is a stronger result.</p><p>We next investigate updates for the four complete PrXML models presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> that are different in succinctness: PrXML mux,det , PrXML exp , PrXML cie and PrXML fie .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DETERMINISTIC UPDATES</head><p>A deterministic update, or simply update, is a triple (q, n, t) also denoted q n,t , where (i) q is a TPJ query, called the condition of the update; (ii) n is a node of q, called the locator of the update; (iii) t is a document such that nodes(t) ∩ nodes(q) = ∅ and possibly with variables Var(t) among its labels, with Var(t) ⊆ Var(q). An update is variable-free if t is a document, i.e., Var(t) = ∅.</p><p>The intuition behind the semantics of updates is the following: if q is satisfied in a document d, then one either inserts t in d as a child of a node corresponding to n, or deletes all nodes corresponding to n together with all their descendants. The way how to insert t depends on the specific semantics of insertions and will be discussed below. For deletions, t is irrelevant and we just denote q n .</p><p>Depending on the type of the query q we distinguish the following classes of updates: TPJ, TP, SP and RSP, where RSP is the subclass of SP where n is the (unique) leaf of q.</p><p>Only-if insertions.

A deterministic only-if insertion oi(q n,t , d) in d by q n,t is a document d obtained from d by rooting t to every v ∈ d such that v = γ(n) for some γ ∈ Val(q, d). Note that t can be rooted to each node of d at most once. Moreover, if there is no valuation of q in d, then oi(q n,t , d) = d.</p><p>For-all insertions. This semantics addresses updates that are insertions of the kind: "For every professor, insert a bonus of X for all EU projects with a duration of X years, that her team is involved in."

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">TRACTABLE CLOSURE WRT UPDATES</head><p>We explore in this section tractability results for deterministic updates. We now introduce a technical term needed further in the proofs. One can extend the notion of matches of queries q ∈ TPJ over documents to p-documents by considering mappings that ignore distributional nodes and are still consistent with the edge types, the labeling, and the variable occurrences in q. We call these matches naive. If γ is a naive match of q in P ∈ PrXML fie , then the formula set of the math γ over q is the set of all the formulas that occur on the edges of the sub p-document γ(q) of P "covered" by q after applying γ.</p><p>Let us start with a straightforward result about the link between the only-if and for-all semantics of insertions when they are used on a very limited query language.</p><p>Lemma 4.

We now investigate the complexity of only-if insertions. The following result is somewhat involved and shows that models with local dependencies behave nicely with respect to simple only-if insertions. Proof. If q n,t is an RSP insertion and there is a naive match γ of q in P ∈ PrXML mux,det ∪ PrXML exp , then one inserts t under γ(n) and iterates the insertion for all such γ that are distinct in n. The resulting p-document is the update oi(q n,t , P) and it has linear size wrt P since there are only linearly many naive matches of q in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P.</head><p>Let q n,t be a descendant-free SP insertion and P be in PrXML mux,det (the generalization to PrXML exp is straightforward). Without loss of generality, assume P has at most two children for every mux node (any P can be transformed in such a form in polynomial time). Let V be the set of all nodes v of P such that there is a naive matches γ with γ(n) = v. Intuitively, V contains the nodes where the insertion can take place.</p><p>For every v ∈ V , the insertion q n,t should add t as a child of v, but only in some of the possible worlds of</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P. For v ∈ V , let</formula><p>Pv be a p-subdocument of P rooted at v, and γ1, . . . , γm the set of all naive matches of q in P such that γi(n) = v for every 1 i m. Then the worlds d where q n,t should bring t under v are exactly those where (at least) one of the γi's matches d.</p><p>In order to describe the resulting px-space with a p-document P , we process v by (i) inserting a mux node v under it, and then (ii) rooting n p-documents , with the resulting document denoted as P . One should also take into account the case when there is no valuation of q in some of P, that is, when the probability of the query is not 1. To do so, one obstructs in P all naive matches of q in P (let the probability of the obstruction be p), and roots the resulting p-document together with P under a common mux node, with the probability p on the edge to the former p-document and 1 − p to the latter.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P v 1 , · · · , P v m under v ,</formula><p>We thus obtain a p-document that is by construction isomorphic to oi(q n,t , P).

Due to this disjointness and the fact that we can compute in polynomial time the probability that a given node occurs in a world of a cie p-document (just compute the probability of the conjunctions of events on the way to the root), we can also compute in polynomial time the probability p that the label v occurs in a world of P . Since p is the same as the probability that q matches P, its computation is a #P-complete problem. Hence, polynomial construction of P implies #P-hardness of the update. The case of TPJ queries and PrXML mux,det (or PrXML exp ) is even simpler, since the probability of TP queries can be computed in polynomial time in such models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>3. Let q n,t be an SP update. If there is a naive match γ of q in P ∈ PrXML fie , then let Γ be the set of all γ such that γ (n) = γ(n).

One iterates the insertion for all such γ that are distinct in n. The number of nodes inserted in P is at most (|t| + 1) · |nodes( P)|, and the number of formulas occurring under introduced cie nodes is at most |formulas( P)|. Hence, the construction of oi(q n,t , P) is linear. For the classes TP and TPJ the proof is similar to the case of SP and the case of RSP is subsumed by SP.

For PrXML cie and SP the proof can be based on the same techniques as in Case 3 of Proposition 6. In short, one inserts a new cie node v under γ(n) for every distinct γ ∈ Γ and roots γ (t) under v. The formula marking the edges from v to root(γ (t)) is ϕ γ . Again linearity follows from the fact that there are linearly many naive matches of SP descendant-free queries in p-documents.</p><p>For PrXML cie and TP, TPJ the proof is analogous to the one for SP. The linearity is lost because the number of valuations is polynomial and the number of introduced events is quadratic.</p><p>For PrXML fie the proof is the same as for PrXML cie .</p><p>Deletions. We now study the complexity of deleting nodes defined by a locator query. The results of the following proposition are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and are exactly the same as for only-if insertions. Proof. 1, 2. The proof is analogous to the one for the first part of Theorem 5. Then one can construct in constant time (i) a p-document P from P by adding a child labeled a to the root of P and a child labeled b to a, and (ii) an update q n by adding a child labeled a to the root of q and a child n labeled b to a. If we can compute the deletion P = del(q n , P ) in polynomial time, then we can also compute the probability p that a is a leaf of P in polynomial time due to the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. At the same time p is the probability that the TPJ query q matches P, which is a #P-hard problem.</p></div>

The formula that labels the edge to γ(n) is ¬ γ ∈Γ ϕ γ , where ϕ γ is the formulas in the formula set of γ .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">PROBABILISTIC UPDATES</head><p>We now discuss a probabilistic variant of updates. An example is, for example, "with a confidence 1/3, make a bulk insertion of a bonus equal to 5 for every professor only if her team is in some EU project." Probabilistic updates are also important because they can be seen as a way to obtain probabilistic documents from regular documents.</p><p>A probabilistic update is a pair (q n,t , p), which we also denote q n,t,p , where q n,t is an update and p ∈ (0, 1] is a rational number, called the confidence in the update. Intuitively, the confidence defines the probability the update operation is carried out.</p><p>Let q n,t,p be a variable-free probabilistic update and d be a document. The probabilistic only-if insertion oi(q n,t,p , d)</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">in d by q n,t,p is the px-space {(d , p), (d, 1 − p)}, where d = oi(q n,t , d). If there is no valuation of q in d, then oi(q n,t,p , d) = {(d, 1)}.</formula><p>The semantics of probabilistic fa-insertions is defined similarly to probabilistic oi-insertions, that is, fa(q n,t,p , d) := {(d , p), (d, 1 − p)}, with the difference that d = fa(q n,t , d).</p><p>We now extend the definition of probabilistic updates to px-spaces. Let q n,t,p be a probabilistic update and S be a px-space. Then the probabilistic for-all insertion fa(q n,t,p , S) in S = {(di, Pr(di)) | i = 1, . . . , n} by q n,t,p is the px-space:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">{(d , Pr (d )) | d ∈ S or d = fa(q n,t , d), for (d, Pr(d)) ∈ S,</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Pr (d ) = p × d∈S fa(q n,t ,d)∼d Pr(d) + (1 − p) × d∈S d∼d Pr(d)}. (2)</formula><p>The only-if insertions oi(q n,t,p , S) are defined for updates q n,t,p with variable-free q and analogous to fa(q n,t,p , S) with the difference that fa should occur in (2) instead of oi. Finally, we define updates for p-documents fa(q n,t,p , P) = fa(q n,t,p , P) and oi(q n,t,p , P) = oi(q n,t,p , P). The syntax and semantics of probabilistic deletions are defined similarly. Note that there is a crucial difference between deterministic and probabilistic updates of a pxspace S. The former never increase the cardinality of the resulting space S , that is |S | |S|, because S consists of the updated versions d of all documents d ∈ S. The latter never decrease the cardinality of the resulting space S , that is |S| |S |, because the resulting space consists of both: all the documents of S and the updated documents d for every document d ∈ S.</p><p>We extend the definitions of closure and tractable closure from deterministic to probabilistic updates in a natural way. In terms of tractable closure, probabilistic updates affects all classes of p-documents in the same way as deterministic updates.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">UPDATING CONTINUOUS PROB. XML</head><p>Many applications of probabilistic databases require the possibility of representing continuous probability distributions. For example, imprecision on the measurement of a sensor may be modeled by a normal distribution centered at the measured value, and a totally unknown value between 0 and 1 by a uniform distribution. We have introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> the semantics for another kind of distributional node, cont, that can be used to specify that a leaf of the tree follows a continuous distribution of a given type (Gaussian, uniform, Poisson, etc.), independently of the distribution of other leaves. In this section, we briefly discuss the complications that arise when updating continuous p-documents.</p><p>Consider the very simple p-document P ∈ PrXML cont that consists of a root with two ordinary children, labeled a and b, each of them having an identical continuous child having uniform distribution between 0 and 1. First, note that the query languages that were defined in Section 2 are not really meaningful in the context of continuous probabilistic documents: the probability of any query imposing a condition on the value of the continuous leaves, or the probability of a value-based join, is 0 since the probability to pick any given constant at random is typically 0. More interesting query languages for continuous data involve range queries. Consider for instance the Boolean (tree-pattern-with-join) range query Q: "Is there an a node whose child has value greater than that of a b node?", and the only-if insertion i that adds a node labeled by c as child of the root if Q matches. The semantics of Q is quite clear, and one can compute the probability that Q matches P, which is 1 2 . On the other hand, it is possible to show that there is no p-document P of PrXML cont,cie that represents the result of applying i to P. Intuitively, this is because in the result document the continuous distributions under a and b nodes are correlated. It is therefore necessary to have a syntax and semantics for correlated continuous distributions (perhaps as an algebra over independent continuous variables) to represent the result of an update over continuous probabilistic documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have discussed the tractability of updates in a variety of probabilistic XML models. The situation is a bit more complex than the one presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>: if it is true that models with arbitrary dependencies (cie, fie) can usually express the result of an update more concisely than local models, at the cost of higher complexity of queries, there are cases (only-if descendant-free SP insertions and deletions) where it is possible to efficiently apply an update to local models and not to a cie document. There are a couple of open issues with respect to the tractability of only-if insertions and deletions. More importantly, an interesting question is the possibility of applying a sequence of updates in a more efficient way than with the exponential algorithm that is given by the simple iteration of the algorithms for elementary updates. Finally, the results of this paper can be extended to insertions of probabilistic documents, either given as constant or obtained as part of the query match.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Document d: personnel in IT department</figDesc></figure>
