				<p>Current web search engines focus on searching only the most recent snapshot of the web. In some cases, however, it would be desirable to search over collections that include many different crawls and versions of each page. One important example of such a collection is the Internet Archive, though there are many others. Since the data size of such an archive is multiple times that of a single snapshot, this presents us with significant performance challenges. Current engines use various techniques for index compression and optimized query execution, but these techniques do not exploit the significant similarities between different versions of a page, or between different pages. In this paper, we propose a general framework for indexing and query processing of archival collections and, more generally, any collections with a sufficient amount of redundancy. Our approach results in significant reductions in index size and query processing costs on such collections, and it is orthogonal to and can be combined with the existing techniques. It also supports highly efficient updates, both locally and over a network. Within this framework, we describe and evaluate different implementations that trade off index size versus CPU cost and other factors, and discuss applications ranging from archival web search to local search of web sites, email archives, or file systems. We present experimental results based on search engine query log and a large collection consisting of multiple crawls.</p>

Such search engines are built on large clusters of hundreds Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2). Distribution of these papers is limited to classroom use, and personal use by others.</p><p>WWW 2007, <ref type="bibr">May 8-12, 2007</ref>, Banff, Alberta, Canada.</p><p>ACM 978-1-59593-654-7/07/0005. or thousands of servers, and employ numerous published and proprietary performance optimizations in order to support thousands of queries per second on billions of web pages. Current search engines focus on providing access to the most recent snapshot of the evolving web. In order to optimize the freshness of their index, search engine crawlers continuously retrieve new web pages, add them to their document set, and then either periodically or continuously update their inverted index to reflect the new data. If the URL of a page has been previously crawled, then the engine typically replaces the old with the newer version, and any information contained only in the older version becomes unavailable.</p><p>While most users are primarily interested in current pages, there are many cases where a search over all previous versions would also be of interest. As one important example, the Internet Archive has collected more than 񮽙񮽙 billion web pages over the last decade in an attempt to archive and preserve the information on the web. It is currently not feasible for the archive to offer full-text search on the entire data for a large user population, due to the high cost of processing a query on such a data set. One reason is that current indexing and query processing techniques, when applied to say ten successive crawls of the same set of URLs, result in index sizes and query processing costs roughly ten times that of a single crawl. Of course, completely identical versions of a page could be simply removed from the index. However, in many cases the new version of a page is different from, but still substantially similar to, the previous one, and it would be desirable to be able to exploit this redundancy to decrease index size and increase query throughput.</p><p>A large amount of recent research by networking, OS, and data compression researchers has focused on the problem of efficiently storing and transmitting redundant data collections. This includes work on differential compression techniques, e.g., for storage and versioning file systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, file synchronization techniques such as rsync <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, and redundancy-eliminating communication protocols for web access or other tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>. Thus, we know how to store and transmit the redundant document collections themselves in a highly efficient manner. However, almost all current techniques for dealing with inverted indexes on such collections, including current index compression techniques, are unable to exploit redundancy across version boundaries (one exception is the very recent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> which we discuss later).</p><p>In this paper, we focus on this problem of how to efficiently index and search collections with significant redundancy. We propose a complete framework for indexing, index maintenance, and query processing on such collections. Our main focus is on archival collections, such as the Internet Archive, that contain several similar versions of the same document. In addition, there are several other scenarios that can be addressed with our approach. General broad-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WWW 2007 / Track: Search Session: Search Potpourri</head><p>based web crawls as well as site-specific collections also tend to have a significant amount of redundancy, particularly within large sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The same is true for email archives where replies often quote from previous messages in the thread. In these cases, our framework also reduces the index size, though by a more moderate factor. It can also support highly efficient updates in the case where old versions are replaced by new versions, and in the case where a remote index is updated across a network. Finally, there are interesting possibilities for applications to desktop search and indexing of versioning file systems that retain old versions of all files. The basic ideas underlying our approach are almost embarrassingly simple, and we now describe them very briefly. First, we use content-dependent string partitioning techniques, e.g., winnowing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> or Karp-Rabin partitioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, to split each document into a number of fragments, say, ½¼ to ¾¾ on average. The main characteristic of these techniques is that similar files will have many fragments in common; this has been previously exploited by OS and networking researchers to save storage and transmission costs on redundant data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. We then simply index these fragments instead of the complete documents, i.e., each distinct fragment is assigned a fragment ID and the index contains references to fragments rather than documents. The result is a much smaller index for collections with significant redundancy. We then design modified algorithms for document-at-a-time query processing that efficiently stitch the fragments back together during evaluation of a query. Finally, by also identifying each fragment by a hash of its content, we can support extremely efficient updates on such indexes, both locally and across a network.</p><p>While the basic ideas are simple, there are various details that complicate matters. In particular, we consider several different fragment sharing policies that trade off index size versus the CPU cost of query processing and the size of certain auxiliary data structures: In some cases, we may limit elimination of identical fragments to different versions of a page or pages within a site, while in other cases we may want to detect duplicate fragments across the entire collection. While some of the ingredients in our approach have been previously employed in several scenarios, we believe that our general framework still makes a significant and novel contribution. As mentioned, redundancy elimination through partitioning of data into blocks has been used to reduce transmission costs and storage sizes for redundant data sets; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>. The most relevant previous results on textual indexing are the Landmarks approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which focuses on efficient index updates when a new version of a document replaces an older one, and the very recent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> on searching redundant collections. The Landmarks approach in particular strongly influenced our approach.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide some necessary background. Section 3 discusses related work in more detail, and Section 4 summarizes the contributions of this paper. Our general framework is introduced and discussed in detail in Section 5. Section 6 presents a preliminary experimental evaluation of our framework using real query logs and web data. Finally, Section 7 provides some concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>We now provide some basic technical background on text indexing, search engine query processing, and redundancy detection through partitioning. In the following definitions, we assume that we have a document collection 񮽙 񮽙 񮽙񮽙¼񮽙 񮽙½ Ò ½ 񮽙 of Ò web pages that are stored on disk. Each document is uniquely identified by a document ID (docID); in the simplest case the documents are just numbered from ¼ to Ò ½. For now we do not distinguish between different documents and different versions of the same document. Let Ï 񮽙 񮽙Û¼ Û½ ÛÑ ½ 񮽙 be all distinct words that occur anywhere in the collection. Typically, almost any text string that appears between separating symbols such as spaces, commas, etc., is treated as a valid word (or term) for indexing purposes.</p><p>Indexes: An inverted index Á for the collection consists of a set of inverted lists ÁÛ ¼ ÁÛ ½ ÁÛ Ñ ½ where list ÁÛ contains a posting for each document containing Û. Each posting contains the ID of the document where the word occurs (docID), the number of occurrences in this document (frequency), the (byte-or word-based) positions of the occurrences within the document (positions), plus possibly other information about the context of each occurrence (e.g., in title, in bold font, in anchor text). In this paper, we assume that each posting is of the form´񮽙񮽙񮽙񮽙񮽙form´񮽙񮽙񮽙񮽙񮽙 Ô¼ Ô 񮽙 ½ µ.</p><p>The postings in each inverted list are usually sorted by docID, and stored on disk in highly compressed form. Thus, Boolean queries can be implemented as unions and intersections of these lists, while phrase searches (e.g., "New York") can be answered by looking at the positions of the two words. We refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> for more details.</p><p>Ranked Queries: We define a query Õ 񮽙 񮽙Ø¼ Ø½ Ø 񮽙 ½ 񮽙 as just a set of terms (words). For simplicity, we ignore issues such as term order in the query, phrase searches, or various other options, though our techniques can be adapted to all of these. The most basic way to perform ranking of results in search engines is based on comparing the words (terms) contained in the documents and in the query. More precisely, documents are modeled as unordered bags of words, and a ranking function assigns a score to each document with respect to the current query, based on the frequency of each query word in the page and in the overall collection, the length of the document, and maybe the context of the occurrence (e.g., higher score if term in title or bold face). Formally, a ranking function is a function 񮽙 that, given a query Õ 񮽙 񮽙Ø¼ Ø½ Ø 񮽙 ½ 񮽙, assigns to each document 񮽙 a score 񮽙´Õµ񮽙´Õµ. The system then returns the, say, ½¼ documents with the highest score. Commonly studied classes of ranking functions include the Cosine and Okapi measures, but current search engines use many other factors in addition to simple term-based ranking. Our techniques are largely orthogonal to these issues. The most important observation for our purposes here is that a ranked query can be processed by traversing the inverted lists for the query terms, and computing the score for each document encountered in the lists, based on the information stored in the postings plus usually some additional statistics stored separately. For various reasons, many web search engines prefer to return documents that contain all (or almost all <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>) of the query terms; in this case, it suffices to only compute the score of any document whose docID is in the intersection of the relevant inverted lists.</p><p>Document-at-a-Time Query Processing: The cost of query processing is usually dominated by that of traversing the inverted lists. For large collections, these lists become very long. Given several billion pages, a typical query involves hundreds of MB to several GB of index data which, unless cached in memory, has to be fetched from disk. Thus, list traversal and intersection computation has to be highly optimized, and should not require holding the complete lists even temporarily in main memory. This is usually done using an approach called document-at-a-time (DAAT) query processing, where we simultaneously traverse the relevant lists from start to end and compute the scores of the relevant documents en passant <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>We later need to adapt this approach to our new index structure, and thus we now provide some more discussion; additional details are available in the appendix. In the DAAT approach, we main-tain one pointer into each of the inverted lists involved in the query, and move these pointers forward in a synchronized manner to identify postings with matching docIDs in the different lists. At any point in time, only one posting from each list is considered and must be available in uncompressed form in main memory. Another advantage of the approach is that it allows us to implement optimizations that skip over many elements when moving forward in the lists <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, while hiding all details of the index structure and compression method.</p><p>Content-Depending File Partitioning Using Winnowing: A significant amount of research in the networking, OS, and data compression communities has focused on eliminating redundancies in large data sets by partitioning each file into a number of blocks and then removing any blocks that have previously occurred. This is usually done by identifying each block by a hash of its content; if we choose the blocks to be large enough, we can limit the number of hashes such that they can be kept in main memory for many scenarios. One problem is how to perform the partitioning. If we simply partition each file into blocks of fixed size and store their hashes, then we would be unable to detect many repeated blocks due to alignment issues. (E.g., if one file differs from another only by a deleted or inserted character at the beginning, none of the blocks would likely match.) In some cases, this can be resolved by checking for all possible alignments between current and previously seen blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>, but in other scenarios this is infeasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>For such cases, several techniques have been proposed that partition a file in a content-dependent manner, such that two similar files are likely to contain a large number of common blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. Among these, we focus on the more recent winnowing technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which appears to perform well in practice.</p><p>Given a file 񮽙 񮽙¼ Ò ½℄, the process runs in two phases:</p><p>(  dred distinct words, and thus a naive scheme for disk-resident indexes would require several hundred changes in different locations on disk. A number of optimizations for index updates have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. If a very high rate of updates needs to be supported, then the best approach appears to be based on periodically pushing updates to the index. That is, when new documents arrive in the system, we first add them to a second, memory-based index structure. To keep this structure from growing beyond memory size, we periodically merge it (or parts of it) into the main index on disk. If the main index is very large, it may be preferable to use a multi-level scheme where the data in memory is first merged into a slightly larger index structure on disk, which itself is periodically merged into an even larger structure, etc. To process a query, we perform separate accesses into each of the index structures (including the one in memory) and then merge the results. This approach has provable performance bounds and is used in a number of systems (e.g., Lucene and the text index of MS SQL Server). Many details depend on the types of updates we need to support, e.g., addition of new documents, deletions, replacement of old versions by newer versions, or addition of newer versions. Note that if we do not store positions in the postings, then a new version of a page that differs very slightly from the previous one may only require updates to a few postings. If positions are stored as well, then a single word added to the beginning of the page may result in updates to all postings. This challenge was addressed by the Landmarks approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which we discuss in more detail later. In general, when a document is added, deleted, or modified, this results in a sequence of insert, delete, and update commands on individual postings that are first buffered in memory and then periodically applied to the larger disk-based structures. The performance of such an update scheme is determined by the number of such commands that are generated, as this determines the frequency and amortized cost of the periodic merges into the disk-based structures. In our later experiments, we will use this as our measure of efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">DISCUSSION OF RELATED WORK</head><p>We now provide some pointers to related work and discuss the most closely related previous work in more detail. For basics of search engine architecture we refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. For background on indexing, ranking, and query execution in IR and web search engines, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. Document-at-a-time query processing is described and evaluated, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Inverted Index Compression: There are a large number of techniques for inverted index compression; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref> for an overview. One simple and popular scheme called var-byte, evaluated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WWW 2007 / Track: Search Session: Search Potpourri</head><p>encodes each posting, frequency, or position in a variable number of bytes. This allows much faster decompression than many bitaligned schemes such as Golomb, Rice, Gamma, or Delta coding that in turn achieve a smaller compressed size. However, very recent bit-aligned schemes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> manage to outperform var-byte in terms of both compressed size and decompression speed. In our experiments, we will use var-byte as well as the recent Simple-9 scheme from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Our approach here is orthogonal to the choice of compression, and can be used in combination with any of these techniques.</p><p>We note that improvements in compression rate can also be obtained by assigning docIDs to pages based on similarity and then applying appropriate local coding models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>. However, these techniques give only fairly moderate improvements, and do no effectively exploit redundancies when pages are very similar. The issue of assigning appropriate docIDs (or in our case, docIDs and fragment IDs) will also come up in our approach.</p><p>File Partitioning and Redundancy Elimination: A number of networking, OS, and data compression researchers have studied the problem of eliminating repeatedly occurring blocks of data from large data sets; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. In some cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, it is possible to use blocks of fixed size, but many other scenarios require the use of content-dependent partitioning techniques such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. We use the winnowing technique in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which according to our experiments performs well in practice in terms of the trade-off between the amount of redundancy detected and the number of blocks that are created. Our initial goal in this work was to study bandwidth-efficient index updates over a network, and we were particularly influenced in this direction by rsync <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> and the Low-Bandwidth File System <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>We also note that a lot of work in the web community has focused on detecting plagiarism, near-duplicate pages, and phraselevel duplication between different documents; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. In fact, the winnowing technique was initially proposed for such purposes rather than for eliminating redundancy for performance reasons. (Our description of this technique in the previous section was adapted to this new scenario.)</p><p>Index Updates: A number of researchers have studied the problem of efficiently updating inverted index structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. As mentioned, current state-of-the-art methods generate posting updates that are only periodically merged into the disk-based structures, rather than directly applying changes on disk.</p><p>Most relevant to our work here is the Landmarks approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which focuses on the case where an old version of a web page is replaced with a updated, but often very similar, version. If positions are stored in each posting, then a naive approach would have to update almost all postings when a new version arrives, due to changes in alignment. The approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> avoids this by expressing positions relative to certain Landmarks in the page, rather than as absolute offsets from the start of the page. When an update occurs, posting updates are only generated for those areas of the page that have actually changed, and the position information for the Landmarks is updated to account for changes in the offsets from the start of the page. We note that the Landmarks approach can be seen as an implicit partitioning of a page into blocks or fragments, one for each Landmark. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> looked at several heuristics for selecting the Landmarks, but did not consider the above partitioning techniques. One main insight in our work came when we realized the relationship between file synchronization techniques such as rsync and the index update approach in Landmarks.</p><p>However, there are also a number of differences to our work. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> focuses on the scenario where old versions of pages are replaced by newer ones, and does not consider the case of archival collections and collections with redundancies between different URLs, which is the main focus of our work. We use contentdependent partitionings and identify each resulting fragment by a hash. Our approach also supports efficient updates over a network, and does not require access to the complete outdated version during updates. In summary, we believe our framework provides an elegant generalization and significant extension to the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Indexing of Redundant Content: Very recent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, published while our work was in progress, describes alternative approaches for indexing text collections with redundancy. The basic idea is also to avoid repeated indexing of content that is shared between different pages or different versions of a page. However, the approaches taken are somewhat different from ours. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, similar documents are organized in a tree structure where each node is a document with some private and some shared content, and each node inherits its ancestors' shared content. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, common parts of different versions of a document are identified by solving a multiple sequence alignment problem. The approaches in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> also use adaptations of standard DAAT query processing. They do not consider incremental updates, but require that the collection is fully available during indexing. There are interesting opportunities for future research that combine ideas from these approaches with our own.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS PAPER</head><p>We study the problem of indexing and searching large web page collections with redundancy, and propose a new and general framework that results in significant savings in the size of the inverted index and the performance of query processing.

We use the term fragment to</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WWW 2007 / Track: Search Session: Search Potpourri</head><p>refer to a block of data produced by applying a content-dependent partitioning technique to a page. Pages are identified by a docID, while fragments are identified by a fragID. Basic Indexing Process: To index a new version of a page, we first partition it into a number of fragments. However, before running winnowing, we first remove all HTML tags from the page and then hash each word in the resulting text page to an integer value; in fact, it suffices to hash to an unsigned char. We then run winnowing on the resulting unsigned char array, where each character corresponds to a single word -this guarantees that partitioning aligns with word boundaries. By using values of Û between ½¼¼ and ¾¼¼, we obtain fragments containing 񮽙¼ to ½¼¼ words on average; thus the typical web page is divided into about ½¼ to ¾¼ fragments.</p><p>We then compute an MD5 hash over the content of each fragment, and check a global table to see if a fragment with this hash has been previously indexed. If yes, then we do not index this fragment. Otherwise, we assign a unique fragment ID (fragID) to this fragment, and add for each term in the fragment a posting of the form´Ö񮽙񮽙Áform´Ö񮽙񮽙Á Ô¼ Ô 񮽙 ½ µ, where 񮽙 is the number of occurrences of the term in this fragment and the Ô񮽙 are the offsets of the occurrences from the start of the fragment. We will later discuss how to best generate fragIDs, as this impacts query processing and index size. For now, we observe that these postings can be treated by the index just as normal postings, and that the average gap between consecutive fragIDs in the inverted lists increases while the average values of 񮽙 and the Ô񮽙 decrease, relative to the docIDs, frequencies, and positions in a standard index.</p><p>Finally, for each page, we maintain a data structure that keeps track of the different versions of the pages and which fragments each version consists of. This structure will be stored in compressed form, and is updated whenever we add a new page or version to the index (even if a page consists completely of already existing fragments).</p><p>Data Structures: Search engines typically contain three major data structures that are needed for query processing:</p><p>¯ the inverted index, consisting of inverted lists sorted by docID and mapped into one or several large files, ¯ a dictionary structure which stores for each distinct term in the collection a pointer to the start of the inverted list for this term, plus useful statistical information such as the number of documents containing the term, and ¯ a page table which stores for each docID the length of the corresponding page in words, other useful information such as the Pagerank value of the page, and possibly the complete URL of the page.</p><p>The structures are illustrated in the top half of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.1. To execute a query, we first use the dictionary to find the start of the inverted lists of the query terms, then compute the top-½¼ results by traversing the lists and computing scores using the posting information and the additional statistics kept in the dictionary and page table, and finally we use the information in the page table to fetch the actual pages for the top-½¼ results in order to return meaningful text snippets with the results.</p><p>In our framework, we add several new data structures, shown in the bottom half of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Algorithms for Local and Global Sharing</head><p>We now consider query processing in our new index organization. In particular, we consider two different sharing policies: ¯ Global Sharing: In this policy, we allow unrestricted redundancy elimination across pages. Thus, if a fragment has previously occurred in any other page, it is not indexed again. ¯ Local Sharing: In this policy, we only avoid re-indexing of a fragment if it has previously occurred in a version of the same page.</p><p>Note that there are other interesting choices in between these two, such as allowing fragment sharing only among pages on the same site. Since such pages are more likely to be similar than random pages from other sites, this might achieve most of the benefits of global sharing without some of the costs. We focus here on the two above extreme cases.</p><p>Concerning the assignment of fragIDs to fragments, it will be desirable to number fragments in a way such that fragments occurring in the same page are close to each other in the inverted lists. This is easy to do if we have no updates, while a little bit more work is needed in the update case. However, even with updates this is possible if suitable adjustments to the numbering scheme are performed as part of the periodic update operations to the disk-based index that are performed by efficient update schemes. It it sometimes useful to assume that a fragID is actually a pair consisting of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WWW 2007 / Track: Search</head><p>Session: Search Potpourri the docID of its primary page and a fragment number; i.e., ´´´񮽙 ¿µ means that a fragment occurred first in page 񮽙񮽙 and was the fourth fragment that occurred first in that page. In terms of actual posting structure, we may either store the fragID as one number or as two smaller numbers, assuming care is taken to use an appropriate index compression technique. Our query processing can be seen as consisting of three phases, (i) identification of pages that contain all query words (whether or not they occur in the same version), (ii) for each such page a check if any version of the page contains all words (this requires retrieval of the doc/version table to understand how fragments map to versions), and (iii) computation of the actual score for a page or version. Note that this possibly also allows us to rank pages and versions based on other factors such as when and how long a page contained the query words, or other temporal factors that we do not explore in this paper.</p><p>Query Processing with Global Sharing: In this case, we process a query in a similar manner as in a standard index, by scanning lists from start to end. However, there are some differences: In standard indexes, we can often skip forward over many postings (using nextGEQ()), while the existence of global sharing now prevents us from doing so in many cases. For example, consider the case of a query for "cat","dog", and "sheep" where "cat" is the shortest list and "sheep" the longest, and "cat" occurs first in fragID´´񮽙 fragID´´񮽙 ½µ, "dog" occurs first in´¾񮽙in´¾񮽙 ¼µ, and "sheep" occurs first in´´񮽙in´´񮽙 ¿µ.</p><p>Suppose we start by reading the first posting in the "cat" list, with fragID´´񮽙fragID´´񮽙 ½µ. Then we cannot simply follow the standard DAAT approach: If the fragment´´񮽙fragment´´񮽙 ½µ is also used in a version of page 񮽙, then we have to make sure not to skip any fragments for page 񮽙 in the "dog" list since a match for "dog" there would indicate that each of the three words occurs at least in some version of page 񮽙. If the fragment´¾񮽙fragment´¾񮽙 ¼µ also occurs in page 񮽙, then we cannot even skip any fragments for page 񮽙 in the "dog" list.</p><p>In other words, global sharing restricts the amount of skipping we can perform in the index traversal when computing an intersection. In particular, in all lists, in addition to the stops implied by standard DAAT, we need to stop to check for the existence of any postings for fragIDs that are later reused in another page. If such a posting exists, we also need to stop to check for any postings in pages where those fragIDs are later reused -we can find the docIDs and thus fragIDs of those later pages through a lookup into the fragment reuse table. If reuse is concentrated on a few fragments that are reused by many other pages, then we can still get a reasonable amount of skipping in the index, but in other cases we end up traversing all postings. In general, when we find a posting that is later reused, we create a ticket that stores the information in the posting itself and the pages where the fragID is reused later, and we put these tickets into a priority queue organized by the docID of the next reuse. As we later visit postings that match a ticket, we update and eventually erase the ticket.</p><p>A few remarks about the costs of this scheme. Forward skips in DAAT processing can save a significant amount of CPU time as we can avoid uncompressing all postings (but the importance of this aspect may be more modest for very recent schemes such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> that can decompress postings at a rate of several GB per second). On the other hand, skipping seems to rarely save much on disk transfer times given current disk performance characteristics, as skips are rarely long enough to skip a large enough chunk of data on disk. (In our experiments, the query processor ended up almost always fetching all the list data). There is additional time and space overhead due to the priority queue; however, we find that most sharing is fairly local, i.e., between pages on the same site, and thus the queue stays fairly small most of the time.</p><p>Query Processing with Local Sharing: If we only allow local sharing, then the above algorithm simplifies in several ways. First, we do not need a fragment reuse table at all. Second, no tickets are required, and we can essentially run standard DAAT on the index to implement phase (i). On the other hand, we would expect a larger index size. Local sharing alone should already give decent benefits if there are many versions of each page, but of course will give no benefit at all for a single snapshot of pages with a certain amount of redundant content between different pages.</p><p>Discussion: In summary, our approach requires changes in query processing that may result in additional computational and memory costs. The details depend on our choice of sharing policy (local, global, or in between), but also on whether we assume AND or OR semantics for our query terms. For AND, we may not be able to perform as many forward skips, while for OR this is less of an issue. On the other hand, fast schemes for OR often use precomputed quantized score that take document lengths into account; it is not clear how to do this in our approach where a fragment may occur in several documents of different lengths. Finally, additional differences and challenges may arise once we add early-termination techniques to the query processor, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Index Updates</head><p>We now consider how to use our framework for efficient updating of the index. First, consider the case of a new version (or new page) being added to the index. In this case, we partition the page into fragments, look up the hashes of the fragments in the hash table, and then index only those fragments that do not find a match while discarding the others. In addition, we update or insert the appropriate records in the various tables. As we index the new fragments, we generate postings that are first inserted into a main-memory structure and later periodically merged into diskbased structures. One nice feature of the approach, and advantage over Landmarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, is that we do not even have to fetch the old version of the page from disk.</p><p>This leads to a very simple protocol for the case where, say, a crawler needs to update a remote index over a network. In the first phase, we send only the MD5 hashes of the fragments, and the index replies with a bit vector indicating which hashes found a match. In the second phase, we send only those fragments that did not find a match. We note that this protocol is of course very close to rsync <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, LBFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and similar schemes for distributing redundant data sets. In general, our approach naturally combines with transmission and storage schemes based on block-wise elimination of redundancies, with interesting implications for possible applications in storage and file systems.</p><p>Finally, we can also support updates where a new version replaces an older version. In this case, in addition to creating new postings for new fragments, we also need to delete old fragments that are not used by any page anymore. This is done most efficiently by first adding a "delete fragment" command to a mainmemory structure, and propagating the deletion to disk during the next periodic merge of the updates onto disk. One assumption in this approach is of course that we can hold a strong enough hash value for each fragment in memory; our experiments indicate that this is realistic for many scenarios. (If no incremental updates are performed, then of course the hash table is not needed at all during query processing.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Application Scenarios</head><p>We now briefly summarize a few of the scenarios and applications that are covered by our framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WWW 2007 / Track: Search</head><p>Session: Search Potpourri ¯ Archival Search: This is the main focus of our presentation here, where for each page we have a number of different versions.</p><p>¯ Redundant Web Collections: Pages from the same site, or even from different sites, often share common blocks of data that can be eliminated with our approach.</p><p>¯ Email and Personal Files: As also observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, large amounts of email data, and collections of personal files, also frequently contain significant amounts of common data.</p><p>¯ Versioning File Systems: As indicated in the previous subsection, our techniques are uniquely suited for integration with versioning file systems that keep all versions of files, or with any storage systems that use block-wise redundancy elimination when storing data. Another interesting application in this direction might be for use in revision control systems for code or documents.</p><p>¯ Distributed Indexing: As also discussed, our approach allows efficient updating over a network. This includes indexing in distributed/P2P systems as well as functionalities such as the "search across machines" feature in Google Desktop Search that synchronizes indexes across machines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION</head><p>We now present our results from a preliminary experimental evaluation of our approach. We first describe the data sets, then evaluate the amount of redundancy detected by our schemes, and then provide some limited results for an actual compressed index structure and query processor implementing our framework.</p><p>Data Sets: The main data set for our evaluation was extracted from a set of ½½ weekly crawls of several hundred large sites during Spring 2006 that was made available by the Stanford WebBase project. Each crawl consisted of about ¾ million pages that were obtained by starting from the same set of seed pages in each site. However, due to changes in the site structure over time, this resulted in somewhat different sets of URLs that were crawled in each week. Thus, the set does not contain ½½ versions of each page, or even most pages. We preprocessed the set by removing all pages that we could not effectively parse (mostly pages primarily or completely in Flash or Javascript), and by removing all exact duplicates among the versions. Exact duplicates are easily handled with existing techniques and thus not a good measure of the efficacy of our approach. This left us with a total of 6,356,374 versions of pages from 2,528,362 distinct URLs. Thus, on average there were only ¾񮽙񮽙 versions of each page, though some pages have more versions while many others have only one.</p><p>We show the cumulative distributions of the number of URLs and number of versions over the ½½ weeks in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>.1. As we see, about 񮽙¼± of the URLs and ½½± of the total data (versions) is concentrated in the crawl for the first week, while afterwards new versions and URLs arise at some smaller but fairly constant rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Distinct Fragments and Term Positions:</head><p>We first look at the resulting numbers of fragments and the amount of redundancy that we observed in the collection. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 6.2</ref> and 6.3, we see the reduction in the number of fragments and total number of term positions that occurs when we eliminate duplicate fragments under a local sharing policy. For the first crawl, where there are no different versions of the same URL, the ratio is (of course) essentially ½񮽙¼, with very minor savings due to fragments repeated within the same version of a page. When we use data from all ½½ Next, we compare local versus global fragment sharing policies in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>.4. We see that for our data set there is a significant additional benefit due to sharing between different pages. For a window size of Û 񮽙 񮽙¼, we observe almost a factor of 񮽙 in reduction in the number of fragments, while even for Û 񮽙 ¿¼¼ we get a factor of ¾񮽙񮽙, when compared to an index with no redundancy elimination. window sizes, and thus the difference between the two methods increases for small Û. This agrees with our expectation that different versions of the same page are more similar, and have larger blocks of common content, than similar but different pages. (Recall that the difference between local and global sharing is due to matches not available in other versions, but only in other pages.) Compressed Size and Query Performance: We now show some preliminary results on the actual compressed index size and the cost of processing queries. All subsequent results are for a window size of Û 񮽙 ½¼¼ on the ½½ crawls, and were performed on a machine with a ¿񮽙¾ Ghz Pentium-4. We experimented with two different index compression techniques, the simple byte-aligned varbyte method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and the very recent word/bit-aligned Simple-9 technique in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Both schemes were reimplemented and carefully optimized by us, resulting in decompression speeds of between ½½¼ and ¿¿¼ million integers per second for var-byte, and between ¾¼¼ and 񮽙¼¼ million integers per second for Simple-9. Overall, Simple-9 consistently outperformed var-byte in terms of decompression speed. As observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, decompression speed varies based on the sizes of the numbers involved. For our standard index, we observed decompression speeds close to the upper limits of the ranges for docIDs and frequencies (which tend to be smaller values), and closer to the lower limit for position information (which also dominates the size of the index overall). We note that these numbers slightly shift as we move from docIDs to fragIDs with larger gaps but smaller frequency and position values.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref>.1: Comparison of resulting index sizes for a standard index and for fragment-based indexes with local and global sharing. Shown from left to right are the number of fragments, total number of positions stored, index size under var-byte compression, index size under Simple-9 compression, and index size under Simple-9 when no position information is stored.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref>.1, we compare the resulting index sizes for a standard index, an index with local sharing, and an index with global sharing. We note that Simple-9 achieves a smaller compressed size than var-byte, and that the advantage becomes more pronounced for local and global sharing. The reason is that var-byte cannot exploit the smaller frequency and position values in indexes with local and global sharing, as it must use at least one byte for every value that is compressed. For Simple-9, we observe a reduction in index size by a factor of ¾ for local sharing, and almost ¿ for global sharing, over a standard index. We also note that benefits are much smaller, and in many cases nonexistent, for index structures that do not store position information; for local sharing, we see an increase in index size while for global sharing we get a small benefit. This is not surprising since a fragment-based index essentially stores approximate position information (i.e., in which fragment a term occurs) that is not available in a standard index without positions. However, for sets with enough redundancy (many versions or very similar pages) our approach would also give significant benefits.</p><p>Next, we look at the performance of a prototype that implements query processing on fragment indexes. We limit ourselves here to local sharing and the var-byte compression scheme. The inverted index resides on disk, and the query processor uses a mainmemory cache of size 񮽙½¾ MB for index data. We then issued ½¼¼¼ queries selected at random from a publicly available trace of the Excite search engine, starting with an empty cache. (Performance should be slightly better when starting with a hot cache.) <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref>.2 shows that disk accesses during query processing decrease by almost 񮽙¼±, which is slightly better than the reduction in index size for var-byte from Table 6.1. The reason is that the reduced index size also results in a higher hit ratio in the list cache, as a higher percentage of the index now fits in memory. Total wall clock time is also reduced significantly, though not as much as I/O. We note here that we are using a somewhat older version of our query processor, and that optimizations would decrease these numbers somewhat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setup</head><p>Million  Finally, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref>.3 we show the cost savings during index updates when compared to the baseline method of inserting each posting. We see that each new version of a page results in about ¾¾¼ new positions, compared to about 񮽙񮽙¼ for the baseline method.</p><p>Overall, we believe that our results indicate the potential for significant performance improvements with our framework.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a new framework for indexing and query processing on textual collections with significant amounts of redundancy. This includes as important cases archival collections containing many versions of documents, and general collections of web pages, emails, or personal files that have some amount of redundancy. Our preliminary evaluation showed the potential for significant benefits, but there are several ways to further optimize our methods. For example, a new content-dependent file partitioning approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> might give slight improvements in the trade-off between the number of fragments and the amount of redundancy detected.</p><p>There are a number of intriguing possibilities for future research. It would be nice to combine our framework with the approaches in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> to further improve compression. In general, it seems that redundancies between versions or pages provide a new avenue for further improvements in index compression, similar to the gains in document and file compression that have been obtained from global redundancy elimination techniques (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>).</p><p>We are particularly interested in exploring applications of the approach in file and storage systems (including versioning file systems and revision control systems). We observe that storage systems typically perform redundancy elimination in a manner that is completely transparent to the higher levels, and our indexing approach would thus have to be implemented at the lower levels for best performance. Extensions to regular expression search would also be of interest.</p><p>Finally, it might be interesting to reexamine the query processing issue in the case of significant global sharing. It could be that in this case, a pure DAAT approach is not the best due to the extra complexity, or that the ideas from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> are more appropriate than unrestricted sharing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 . 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>212</label><figDesc>Figure 2.1.

For efficiency reasons, it is useful to distinguish between local sharing, where a fragment occurs repeatedly in different versions of one page, and global sharing, where fragments are reused in versions of other pages. Each frag- ment has a primary page, which is the first page where it occurs. Entries in this table are only created when an already existing fragment is reused in another page. We note that in some scenarios, we can remove or merge some of the structures, as we discuss later. For example, the hash table is only needed during updates. In terms of memory resources, the largest new structure is typically the hash map which (for large data sets and with proper prefix compression) can be stored in about 񮽙 bytes for each pair of a 񮽙񮽙-bit hash and a ¿¾-bit fragID. (We chose 񮽙񮽙 bits as this results in a fairly low probability of any hash colli- sions even for moderately large data sets.
