				<p>Due to the economic importance of the position auctions used by search engines to sell advertising, these auctions have received considerable recent study. However, most of this study has been analytic, and these analyses have relied on strong assumptions about the structure of the setting. In this paper, we show that it is feasible to perform computational equilibrium analyses of complex, realistic auction problems like advertising auctions. In particular, we show for the first time that the Nash equilibria of position auctions can be computed exactly, and we do so without relying on any of the assumptions that are necessary for closed-form analysis. We achieve these results by deriving a polynomial-sized action graph game representation of the position auction (discretizing bid amounts) and then finding a Nash equilibrium of that game. Our formulation makes it possible to show how equilibrium behavior, revenue and efficiency vary across auction types (Generalized First Price or Generalized Second Price), payment structures (pay-per-click or pay-per-impression), and click-through bias (position does/does not also depend on advertiser&apos;s click-through rate).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Modern search engines derive their revenue from contextual advertising: given a user's keyword search, the engine provides relevant ads alongside the results. The search engine chooses which ads to show based on the results of "position auctions" that are conducted automatically every time a search is performed. In a position auction, higher bids are awarded higher positions in the list of ads, but also made to pay larger amounts. In what follows we explain position auctions, describing different versions of auction type (GFP/GSP), payment structure (pay-per-click/pay-per-impression) and click-through bias (position does/does not also depend on advertiser's click-through rate) First, we describe auction type. The two most common types of position auctions are generalized first-price and generalized second-price; these are the types upon which we focus in this paper. Both auction types ask bidders to submit single-value bids and then rank the bids from highest to lowest, awarding the highest bidder the highest position, the second-highest bidder the second-highest position, and so on. The auction types differ in the way that bidders are charged. In a generalized first-price auction (GFP) each bidder who wins a position pays the amount that he bid. In a generalized second-price auction (GSP), on the other hand, each bidder pays the minimum amount that he would have had to bid to maintain his awarded position. (For example, the highest bidder pays the amount of the second-highest bid, because if he had bid less than this amount, he would have received the second position instead of the first.) The earliest position auctions deployed commercially were GFP, but all of the major search engines have since adopted GSP.</p><p>Second, position auctions differ according to whether they require bidders to pay per impression or pay per click. In a pay-per-impression auction, the bidder must pay every time his ad is shown, while in a pay-per-click auction, the bidder only pays when a user clicks on his ad. Search engines use pay-per-click auctions, though pay-per-impression advertising is used in other online contexts such as banner ads.</p><p>Finally, some ads are more frequently clicked on than others. Some search engines bias their auction rules to take this fact into account. Specifically, they assign each ad a "quality score" that reflects its likelihood of receiving a click, and rank bids by the product of the bid and the quality score (i.e., by the expected revenue that the ad will yield) rather than by the bid amount alone. We refer to auctions that rank by quality score as weighted auctions, to auctions that rank only by bid amount as unweighted auctions, and to the product of a bid and a quality score as an effective bid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">AGGs</head><p>Since analyses of position auctions have relied on perfectinformation games, in principle we could discretize bid amounts and then represent the auction as a normal-form game. This would have the advantage that Nash equilibria of the auction could be identified by standard computational tools such as Gambit <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The catch, of course, is that the normal form representation of a realistic ad auction problem is unmanageably large. For example, the normal form representation of a relatively small game with 10 agents and 10 bid amounts per agent consists of 100 billion values, too many to store even on the hard drive of many modern computers-let alone in RAM. Thus, to have any hope of tackling position auctions computationally, it is necessary to work with a representation language that allows the game to be compactly described.</p><p>We chose to use the action-graph game (AGG) representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Action-graph games are similar to the more widely-known graphical game representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in that they exploit utility independencies. AGGs are strictly more powerful than graphical games, however. This is because AGGs are compact not only for games with "strict utility independencies" (the property that one agent's payoff never depends on some second agent's action) but also "context-specific independencies" (one agent's payoff is independent of a second agent's action, at least for some action of the first agent and some set of actions of the second). This distinction is important for modeling position auctions. Note that any bidder can affect any other bidder's payoff (e.g., by outbidding him); hence the graphical game representation of a perfectinformation position auction is a clique, meaning that it is no more compact than the normal form. However, position auctions have considerable context-specific independence structure. To give one simple example, in a GFP auction, bidder i's utility is independent of bidder j's bid, conditional on j bidding less than i. This is the sort of structure that can be captured by AGGs.</p><p>The core idea behind action-graph games is the action graph, so-called because nodes in this directed graph represent actions. Each agent is allowed to choose his action from an arbitrary subset of the nodes; crucially, agents' subsets are allowed to overlap or coincide. Play of the game can be visualized as each agent simultaneously placing a single token on one of the nodes in the graph. Given the locations of all the tokens, an agent's utility can be computed by referring only to the number of tokens in the neighborhood of his chosen node. (The neighborhood of a node v is the set of all nodes having outgoing edges that point to v; self-edges are allowed, and so a node can belong to its own neighborhood.) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> gives an example of an action-graph game taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Observe that there are two action sets consisting of four actions each; unlike in a graphical game, the number of agents cannot be inferred from the graph.</p><p>Their compact size is not the only interesting thing about AGGs. More importantly, AGG structure can be leveraged computationally, and hence game-theoretic computations can be performed dramatically more quickly for AGGs than for games represented in normal form. For example, given action graphs with bounded in-degree, a polynomialtime dynamic programming algorithm can be used to compute an agent's expected utility under an arbitrary mixed strategy profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. (Observe that this is interesting because the standard method of computing expected utility has running time polynomial in the size of the normal form, but potentially exponential in the size of more compact representations like AGGs.) This computational problem is important because it constitutes the inner loop of many game-theoretic algorithms, including state-of-the-art algorithms for computing Nash equilibria like Simplicial Subdivision <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Govindan-Wilson <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This implies that an exponential speedup to the solution of the expected utility problem translates directly to an exponential speedup of such algorithms, without any effect on the solution obtained.</p><p>Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to describe AGGs in detail, there is one further element of the representation that we must describe here. Specifically, it is possible to add so-called function nodes to the action graph, which are nodes that belong to no agents' action sets. In- Note that this game exhibits context-specific independence without any strict independence, and that the graph structure is independent of n.</p><p>Other examples of compact AGGs that cannot be compactly represented as graphical games include: location games, role formation games, traffic routing games, product placement games and party affiliation games.</p></div>

For example, when an agent's payoff for playing a depends on how many agents play any of b, c or d, we can add a summation node to reduce the in-degree of a. Function nodes can dramatically reduce representation size when (for example) many actions affect a given action in the same way. As long as the functions are wellbehaved ("contribution-independent"; roughly, commutative and associative) function nodes can be used with the dynamic programming algorithm from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Since the variable most important to the asymptotic running time of this algorithm is the maximal in-degree of action nodes, and since this quantity can be drastically reduced by the introduction of high-in-degree function nodes, function nodes can also lead to substantial computational savings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MODEL AND REPRESENTATION 2.1 Ad auction setting</head><p>In our evaluation of auction types, we use the following model. As in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, we look for the equilibria of the one-shot, full-information game.</p><p>Definition 1 (Ad auction setting).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Representing GFPs as Action-Graph Games</head><p>Having described the auction types and model that we intend to solve, our next step is to show that they can be compactly represented. This section will present algorithms for representing an ad auction type (for example, weighted per-click GSP) and auction setting as an action-graph game and bounds on the size of those representations.</p><p>To get a suitably compact representation, one of our biggest concerns is the maximum in-degree of our action graph. Every action node must have a table representing that action's payoff function, and this table will grow exponentially in the in-degree of that action node. An arc (u, v) in an AGG denotes that the payoff for playing action v depends on the number of agents playing u. However, note that an agent's payoff depends only on the position he is awarded and the price he is made to pay. In the case of a GFP, an agent's price is determined by his bid while his position is determined by the number of bids above his and the number of bids equal to his. (We assume that ties are broken randomly.) His position can be affected by many different actions by other bidders, leading to a very large in-degree. However, if we introduce function nodes corresponding to summation (we will call these summation nodes) to keep track of how many bids are equal to or greater than each possible bid value, we need only two in-arcs to capture the two values.</p><p>Algorithm 1 converts a weighted (or, as a special case, unweighted 1 ) GFP to an AGG.

For a bid of b by agent i, we denote this as γ 1,I</p><p>i,b for a pay-per-impression GFP. Because 1 Trivially, this algorithm can also be used to represent an unweighted GFP by replacing β with a vector of ones, causing the auction to treat bids by different agents equivalently. of the configuration of the summation nodes, the two inputs to this function are the number of effective bids that are equal to i's bid of b and the number that are greater than or equal. The payoff function for any action node in a pay-per-impression GFP is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">γ 1,I i,b (e, g) = 1 e min(g,k) X j=g−e+1 (Pj,iVj,i − b).</formula><p>Similarly, the payoff function for any action node in a payper-click GFP is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">γ 1,C i,b (e, g) = 1 e min(g,k) X j=g−e+1</formula><p>Pj,i(Vj,i − b).</p><p>This representation results in a graph containing nm action nodes, each of which has an in-degree of two. Each node has a payoff table with at most O(n 2 ) relevant entries. Thus, this representation requires O(n 3 m) space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Representing GSPs as Action-Graph Games</head><p>GSPs are similar to GFPs in that each agent's payoff depends on a small number of values. To determine the position (or range of positions), we use the exact same graph structure as for GFPs. However, we need to augment the graph to capture the pricing rule of GSPs. This is done by adding "price nodes", function nodes that identify the next-highest bid. We use the term argmax node to refer to a function node whose value is equal to the largest (given some arbitrary ordering) in-arc carrying a non-zero value. By ordering action nodes according to the value of their effective bids, an argmax node identifies the highest effective bid among the subset of action nodes connected to it. After running the Algorithm 1, we add argmax nodes as shown in Algorithm 2. An example of the resulting action graph is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>. Note that although the in-degree of the argmax nodes can get large (O(nm)), the computational complexity of solving an AGG only depends on the in-degree of the action nodes.</p><p>foreach effective bid e ∈ E do create an argmax function node, (p, e) representing the next highest effective bid below e; foreach action node a with effective bid e do if e' &lt; e then add an arc from a to (p, e); if e' = e then add an arc from (p, e) to a;</p><p>Algorithm 2: An algorithm for converting an auction setting into an action graph representing a GSP.</p><p>As in the case of GSP, we must define a payoff function for each action node. Now, we have a third input (p), which identifies the next-highest effective bid. Let Ep denote this value. The payoff function for any action node in a pay-perimpression GSP is given below. 2 : To represent a GSP as an AGG, we add price nodes (argmax nodes denoted by hexagons) to a GFP representation. For clarity only one price node is pictured, while a full GSP representation requires one price node for each effective bid.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">γ 2,I i,b (e, g, p) = 1 e min(g−1,k) X j=g−e+1 (Pj,iVj,i − b) +δ(g ≤ k)(Pj,gVj,g − Ep)/e</formula><p>Similarly, the payoff function for any action node in a payper-click GFP is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">γ 2,C i,b (e, g, p) = 1 e min(g−1,k) X j=g−e+1 Pj,i(Vj,i − b) +δ(g ≤ k)Pj,g(Vj,g − Ep)/e</formula><p>This representation results in a graph containing nm action nodes, each of which has an in-degree of three. Each node has a payoff table with at most O(n 2 |E|) relevant entries (where |E| ≤ nm). Thus, this representation requires O(n 4 m 2 ) space. As was the case with GFPs, we can produce an unweighted auction by simply replacing β with a vector of ones. We can find also AGG representations of Lahaie and Pennock's family of ranking rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> by adjusting the values of β appropriately.</p><p>In summary, we model eight auction types by the following methods:</p><p>1. unweighted, pay-per-impression GFP: replace β with a vector of ones, generate graph according to Algorithm 1, γ 1,I payoff function 2. weighted, pay-per-impression GFP: generate graph according to Algorithm 1, γ 1,I payoff function 3. unweighted, pay-per-click GFP: replace β with a vector of ones, generate graph according to Algorithm 1, γ 1,C payoff function 4. weighted, pay-per-click GFP: generate graph according to Algorithm 1, γ 1,C payoff function 5. unweighted, pay-per-impression GSP: replace β with a vector of ones, generate graph according to Algorithm 1 followed by Algorithm 2, γ 2,I payoff function 6. weighted, pay-per-impression GSP: generate graph according to Algorithm 1 followed by Algorithm 2, γ 2,I payoff function 7. unweighted, pay-per-click GSP: replace β with a vector of ones, generate graph according to Algorithm 1 followed by Algorithm 2, γ 2,C payoff function 8. weighted, pay-per-click GSP: generate graph according to Algorithm 1 followed by Algorithm 2, γ 2,C payoff function 3. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Computational Environment</head><p>Our experiments were performed using a computer cluster consisting of 55 machines with dual Intel Xeon 3.2GHz CPUs, 2MB cache and 2GB RAM, running Suse Linux 10.1. All timing results given below report CPU time (rather than wall clock time). To compute Nash equilibria, we used the simplicial subdivision <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> implementation provided by Gambit <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, extended to use AGGs and the dynamic programming algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Problem Distribution</head><p>To evaluate the empirical performance of our approach, we generate instances from a distribution over auction settings.</p><p>The size of the problem is specified by n and m where M = {x|x ∈ Z, 0 ≤ x ≤ m}, i.e. users can bid any integer up to m. For each bidder i, we generated a bidder-specific click-through factor bi ∼ uniform <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>. For each position j (up to k = min(n/2, 8)), we generate a position-specific click-through factor ej where e1 ∼ uniform <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref> and ej ∼ uniform[0, ej−1]. Each entry in click-through-probability matrix P , is a product of these factors (Pj.i = βiej). For each bidder, we generate a single value per click (which is the same for all positions) drawn from uniform <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>. These values are renormalized so that the highest value is equal to m (these values are normalized per-click or per-impression depending on which type of auction we evaluate). This model is a encodes common assumptions such as separability [28],</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Experimental Results: Computational</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Representation Size</head><p>We compare the our representation size against the corresponding normal form games in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. The size of the normal form game was computed using n 32-bit values per table entry. GSPs are much larger than GFPs because they have higher-dimensional payoff functions. Weighted auctions are smaller than unweighted because they have far fewer ties (meaning the payoff function needs to be evaluated in fewer places). Because pay-per-click and pay-per-impression have identical graph structures and identical potential for ties, they result in the same representation size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Performance</head><p>To evaluate the empirical hardness of solving our AGG representations, we drew 200 samples from the problem distribution described above (for n = 10, k = 5, m = 10). For each instance, we represented all eight auction types as AGGs and ran the solver on them for 120 seconds each. The results of this experiment are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. Somewhat surprisingly, GFPs are appreciably harder to solve than GSPs, despite their smaller input size. Emperically, simplicial subdivision often performs faster when solving games with small-support equilibria. Given that GFPs tend to give rise to oscillating equilibria in the repeated case <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, the one-shot game may only have large-support equilibria.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: ECONOMIC 4.1 Weak Equilibria</head><p>To get meaningful results, we need to consider the problem of weak equilibria. Auctions frequently have many equilibria that can differ in revenue and economic efficiency. In the case of GSPs, each agent can vary his bid within a range that does not affect the ranking of the ads, but does affect the amount that the bidder above must pay. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> Thus, the equilibrium revenue of GSP depends on which strategies each agent chooses from a set of weak best responses. A similar problem arises when we consider the support size of an equilibrium. Our solver could converge to an equilibrium where agents mix needlessly across the range of best response bids.</p><p>To address this problem, we give the bidders a small bias, favoring some bids over others. This is done by perturbing each agent's utility function by a small (10e-6) amount in favor of low (or high) bids regardless of the outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparing Auction Types</head><p>To explore the differences between different auction types, we drew 200 samples from the setting distribution. For each of these settings, we represented all eight auction types, with high, low and no bidding bias (24 games per setting) and computed their equilibria. The following results are based on the 2783 (of 4800) games for which we could compute an equilibrium in under one CPU hour.</p><p>For each Nash equilibrium, we computed the expected revenue (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>) normalized relative to the revenue of the truthful equilibrium of VCG. A number of trends are apparent from this plot. GSPs are more sensitive to equilibrium selection. Unweighted pay-per-impression auctions outperform weighted pay-per-impression auctions while weighted pay-per-click auctions outperform unweighted pay-per-click auctions. This might explain why (with the exception of Yahoo!'s unweighted pay-per-click GSP) these auctions are not found in practice. When bids are discrete, VCG revenue is not a lower bound on the revenue of weighted pay-per-click GSPs.</p><p>We can also compare the expected social welfare generated by an auction. (Note that this is the social welfare of the advertisers.) As was the case with revenue, unweighted pay-per-impression auctions outperform weighted pay-perimpression auctions while weighted pay-per-click auctions outperform unweighted pay-per-click auctions. Despite the coarse bidding language, weighted pay-per-click GSPs find the optimal allocation with extremely high probability. In the case of unweighted pay-per-click GSPs, different bidding biases lead to equilibria with significantly different social welfare. This indicates that the allocations of such auctions are sensitive to some bidder's choice among weak best responses.</p><p>Lastly, we can consider what kinds of equilibria these different auction types give rise to. As described above, GFPs seem to lead to a lot of mixing in equilibrium. To quantify this we measure the Shannon Entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> of the joint strategy (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Given random variable X with distribution p(), the Shannon Entropy is H(X) = − P p(x) log 2 (p(x)). This gives a measure of the uncertainty associated with X, in this case the joint action of the bidders. Our biasing approach seems to be successful: the equilibria we found in biased games have less entropy than the equilibria of the unbiased games. However, unweighted GFPs have much higher entropy, regardless of biasing, which might explain why their Nash equilibria were harder to find.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>For the first time, our work shoes that position auctions, although difficult to analyze manually, are within reach of modern computational methods. We show how the results of these computational methods can be used to compare the economic properties of different auction types.</p><p>There is opportunity for future work both on the preferences and on the computational methods. Within our model of auction settings, we could immediately explore alternative preference distributions that relax common assumptions (such as separability of click-through-rates). Also, better distributions over preferences could be learned from realworld bidding data. There is also the question of how to compactly represent games given a richer preference model. (For example, we could model settings where an ad's click and conversion probabilities depends on which ads are shown above it.) Better computational methods could also improve this approach: by using an equilibrium-finding algorithm that allows us to control which part of strategy space is explored first (such as the support enumeration methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>), we could find desired types of equilibria without perturbing the payoffs of the game.</p></div>
