				<p>Motivated by recent advances in adaptive sparse representations and nonlocal image modeling, we propose a patch-based image interpolation algorithm under a set theoretic framework. Our algorithm alternates the projection onto two convex sets: one is given by the observation data and the other defined by a sparsity-based nonlocal prior similar to BM3D. In order to optimize the design of observation constraint set, we propose to address the issue of sampling pattern and model it by a spatial point process. A Monte-Carlo based algorithm is proposed to optimize the randomness of sampling patterns to better approximate homogeneous Poisson process. Extensive experimental results in image interpolation and coding applications are reported to demonstrate the potential of the proposed algorithms. Index Terms-image interpolation, patch-based models, spatial point process, Monte-Carlo method.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Image interpolation refers to the reconstruction of a plausible image from incomplete data (e.g., pixels at a subset of sampling lattice). Like other inverse problems, image prior plays a critical role in interpolation algorithms. Existing image interpolation algorithms are mostly local -for example, B-spline interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> uses cubic splines to fit local intensity functions; subpixel edge location was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to render sharper edges; local covariance structures can also be used to locally guide the linear interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Most recently, several existing ideas haven been unified under a kernel regression framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, nonlocal image priors have attracted increasingly more attention and found many successful applications (e.g., texture synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, image inpainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, image denoising <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). Nonlocal image interpolation has also appeared in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). However, there still lacks a systematic framework for understanding and analyzing the benefit of nonlocal priors for image interpolation. Given the nature of interpolation problem (a fundamental task in digital image processing), it is our belief that a better solution to image interpolation could shed useful insight to our understanding of other problems.</p><p>In this paper, we present a set theoretic framework for incorporating patch-based nonlocal prior into image interpolation. Based on previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we propose to cast image interpolation under the maximum a posterior (MAP) framework which admits a set theoretic implementation. The likelihood and prior terms respectively give rise to observation constraint and sparsity constraint. In particular, we note that the sparsity constraint can be enforced either locally (e.g., overcomplete DCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or steerable pyramids <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) or nonlocally (e.g., BM3D-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). A strategy of progressive decreasing thresholds proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is adopted to find the solution to the fixedpoint equation characterizing the sparsity constraint. Issues of initial threshold selection and stopping criterion are briefly addressed as well.</p><p>In addition to the prior term, the second contribution of this work is on the likelihood term related to sampling pattern (the subset of sampling lattice). We propose to model sampling pattern by a spatial point process <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Based on previous works of randomness measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we have developed a Monte-Carlo based algorithm to optimize the randomness of sampling patterns and their benefits on image interpolation are justified by experimental results. The flexibility of designing optimal sampling pattern suggests an interesting application into compressive imaging which has potential in wireless sensor networks. A random-sampling protocol is shared by encoder and decoder, which eliminates the need of transmitting any bits to resolve location uncertainty. Such distributed image coding system has achieved highly encouraging performance when compared with conventional wavelet image coders such as SPIHT <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PATCH-BASED IMAGE INTERPOLATION</head><p>We use x, y to denote unobservable image (target of reconstruction) and observation data respectively. For a binary sampling pattern S, we simply have y(m, n) = x(m, n)S(m, n) where (m, n) are the spatial coordinates. Under a Bayesian framework, the interpolation problem can be formulated as the MAP estimation, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(x|y, H) = p(y|x, H)p(x|H) p(y|H)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where H denotes a model we assume (local vs. nonlocal), p(y|x, H) is the likelihood term (it is an indicator function 1 {y(m,n)=x(m,n)} ) and p(x|H) is the prior term that plays the role of regularizing ill-posed problems. One popular choice of the prior term is so-called sparse constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> -i.e., only a small fraction of transform coefficients are significant. A great deal of effort has been spent on constructing good transforms T with maximal sparsity. If we use X = T x to denote the transform coefficients, the sparsity constraint can be enforced by thresholding operator</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">G[X|δ] = X · 1 {|X|&gt;δ }.</formula><p>An alternative to manually selecting a threshold is to use a collection of progressively decreasing thresholds δ 1 &gt; δ 2 &gt; , ..., &gt; δ K = 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Such strategy of progressive thresholding can be interpreted under a set theoretic framework, which makes it more widely applicable as a sparsity-enforcing tool. Referring to <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, we use a two-pixel image to illustrate how progressive thresholding works. The target image x is assumed to at the intersection of C obs (observation constraint specified by the likelihood term) and an oracle manifold M I : {x|x = B[x]} (prior term unknown to us) where B = T −1 GT is the nonlinear thresholding operator in the transform domain. With the knowledge of oracle threshold δ opt , we can approximate MI is by starting from some region (defined by initial threshold δ 1 ) and gradually increasing the search range by lowering the <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Toy-example illustration of POCS with progressively decreasing thresholds: C obs (a line) and C prior (a disk) respectively denote the likelihood and prior constraints for a twopixel image; targeted image is located at the intersection which represents a local approximation of the unknown manifold MI . a) as threshold δ k approaches zero, the support of prior constraint set Cprior increases, which implies a larger search space; b) an over-shooting initial threshold δ 1 would not push x (k) towards MI because the search space is too large.</p><p>threshold. The catch is: if x ∈ CI is a fixed point on MI for some threshold δ k , then it will remain a fixed point for all thresholds larger than δ k (i.e., x (k) will not diverge as the threshold further decreases).</p><p>The contraction mapping property of B has been established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The generality of such fixed-point perspective allows us to enforce sparsity in both local and nonlocal models. For example, instead of using overcomplete DCT or wavelet transforms, we can enforce the sparsity constraint with respect to packed similar patches as BM3D does <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. One pitfall with the progressive thresholding strategy lies in the choice of initial threshold δ1. If the initial threshold δ1 is too small (i.e., overfitting -C prior would contain not only M I but also less meaningful images), projection onto C prior will move little because the constraint is too weak to drag x (k) toward M I . On the other hand, if the initial threshold δ 1 is too large (underfitting -C prior might not intersect with M I at all), it will take a long time to converge and alternating projections in early iterations would be a waste of computations. In practice, we have found the following heuristic rule to work reasonably well -δ1 is set to be the average of all local variances calculated on a block-by-block basis. The complete patch-based image interpolation algorithm is summarized as follows (note that it is conceptually similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MODELING SAMPLING PATTERN VIA SPATIAL POINT PROCESS</head><p>Now, we turn our attention to the likelihood term -in particular, the design of sampling pattern S. In the literature of spatial statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, sampling pattern is viewed as the realization of a spatial point process. Let {s i } be the location of events in R d (we only consider d = 2 here). A spatial point process S on R 2 is a measurable mapping defined by φ(S) = i 1 s i ∈S (i.e., the number of events in the realization S). The complete spatial randomness of a point process is characterized by homogeneous Poisson process <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For any infinitesimal region ds ⊂ R 2 , the point process S is a homogeneous Poisson process if 1) lim |ds|→0</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1−P (φ(ds)=0) |ds| = λ; 2) lim |ds|→0 P (φ(ds)=1) |ds| = λ; 3) φ(ds1), φ(ds2), .</formula><p>.. are statistically independent for any disjoint sequence of regions ds1, ds2, ...; where |B| denotes the volume of set B ⊂ R d and λ is the intensity parameter. It is known that the superposition of two independent Poisson process with parameters λ1, λ2 is a Poisson process with parameter λ1 + λ2.</p><p>There are several classes of measures for quantifying the randomness of a spatial point pattern. The simplest class is quadrat-based -i.e., taking any subset Q ⊂ R 2 of arbitrary shape at random location, the expected counting measure φ(Q) should approach its mean value λ. By repeating such test for a large number of times (i.e., using {Q i }), we can collect a sequence of countering measures {φ(Qi)}. Its deviation from the mean (i.e., the variance</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v(S) = E[(φ(Q) − λ) 2 ])</formula><p>can be used as an indicator of randomness. Other measures (e.g., distance-based) also exist though often involve higher computational complexity due to the need of finding nearest neighbors.</p><p>With the definition of randomness measure, a systematic solution is to simulate spatial point processes via MonteCarlo method <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Starting with any initial configuration S 0 , one can randomly choose a pair of pixels with opposite attributes to flip. If the randomness measure v(S) decreases, accept the new configuration; otherwise accept the new configuration with a probability of exp(−(v(S new ) − v(S old ))). Such Metropolis-like algorithm can be viewed as an iterative optimization procedure of maximizing the randomness of a spatial point process and guarantees to reach a local optimum. To speed up the convergence, heuristics-based solution can be used as the initial configuration. The complete description of MonteCarlo based algorithm for sampling pattern randomization is given below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. APPLICATION INTO COMPRESSIVE IMAGING</head><p>Conventional wisdom in designing image communication systems is to divide-and-conquer. For example, image acquisition, compression and transmission are often handled by three independent components namely sensor (analog-digital conversion), source coding (redundancy reduction) and channel coding (redundancy addition). Such divide-and-conquer strategy is often suboptimal when other resource constraints (e.g., the cost of analog-digital conversion, transmission bandwidth, error rate and delay). There is a new trend of optimizing the system by jointly designing those components (e.g., joint sensingprocessing, joint source-channel coding). Algorithms 1 and 2 presented in this work open the door to design a new compressive imaging system suitable for wireless sensor network applications as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> (such system can also be viewed as a distributed coding of image source since complexity has been shifted from encoder to decoder).</p><p>The most significant departure from the current practice is that only a small percentage of observation data at random locations need to be acquired and transmitted (therefore the complexity of sensor node is extremely low). Note that here observation data have a general meaning -e.g., pixel values in Alg. 1 can be replaced by Gabor filtered samples (accordingly the definition of observation constraint sets varies). We also note that the sampling pattern S (generated by Alg. 2) is assumed to be shared by both encoder and decoder. Therefore there is no need for transmitting any overhead related to location information (by contrast, conventional image coding systems strive to achieve the optimal balance between bits spent on coding location and intensity values). With an appropriately chosen intensity parameter λ, images are reconstructed from the quantized samples at the decoder by Alg. 1. In other words, our guiding principle has evolved from the traditional redundancy reduction to redundancy exploitation, which has been argued as a more plausible hypothesis for sensory processing by human visual cortexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Our compressive imaging system has good error-resilient properties On one hand, since the task of redundancy exploitation is located at the decoder, image quality would have a graceful degradation in the presence of channel errors (damaged samples and missing samples are both exceptions to sparsity constraint which Alg. 1 attempts to correct). On the other hand, superposition property of Poisson process makes it convenient to generate multiple descriptions of an image <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which can support joint reconstruction from an arbitrary collection of descriptions received by the decoder (thanks to the superposition property of Poisson process). We note that the diversity of descriptions can arise from both sampling locations (e.g., S1 ∩ S2 = φ) and filter responses (e.g., Gabor filters with different orientation and scale parameters resembling the rod/cone receptors in human retinas). To simplify the implementation, we have only considered the location-related diversity in our experiments (i.e., a delta-function filter is assumed). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V-A. Image Interpolation</head><p>The implementation of Algorithm 1 is based on the public availability of BM3D demo package 1 . The parameters in Algorithm 1 are fixed in all our experiments: ∆ = 0.02, = 0.001, B = 16, d = 4, Nmax = 16, Ns = 32 (the last four parameters are used by BM3D algorithm). Such choice has been found to achieve good results for a wide class of images. The MATLAB codes and sample images accompanying this paper can be found at http://www.csee.wvu.edu/ ∼ xinl/code/patch recon.zip.</p><p>In the first experiment, we apply Alg. 1 to the interpolation of uniformly-sampled images (i.e., y is a down-sampled version of x). The starting point is chosen to be bicubic interpolation and benchmark scheme also includes new edgedirected interpolation (NEDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> shows the performance comparison among different schemes. It can be seen the benefit of exploiting nonlocal dependency is apparent for resolution enhancement of regular edges (due to their scale-invariant properties). The findings for textures are more interestingfor example, for the first texture image, spatial aliasing is less severe and even bicubic interpolation achieved good result (NEDI is not appropriate for this image due to its abundance of textures). Although patch-based nonlocal interpolation gives slightly lower PSNR than bicubic, we note that the gain remains positive when measured by SSIM metric (bicubic: 0.8803, ours: 0.8860).</p><p>For the second texture image, the reconstructed image does not look like the original (due to severe spatial aliasing) but still represents a perceptually plausible solution. This suggests that image manifold M I could have multiple intersection points with constraint set C prior -when the likelihood term is not sufficient to resolve the ambiguity, reconstructed image might appear drastically different from the original one (refer to the two solid dots in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a)</ref>. <ref type="figure">In Fig. 4</ref>, we have compared <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. PSNR and subjective quality comparison among different reconstruction schemes for four test images: DT-based (starting point of Algo. 1), KR-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Algo. 1 (this work).</p><p>the results with three different sampling matrixes with the same amount of data (75% missing) but increasing amount of randomness: uniform sampling, Hilbert-scanning and pseudorandom sampling (no randomness optimization involved). The benefit of randomness in image reconstruction can already be clearly seen for this example (more justification comes later).</p><p>In our second experiment, we test the performance of Alg. 1 on interpolating nonuniformly-sampled images. Observation data y is obtained by randomly throwing away 75% pixels in an image. We use Delaunay-triangle (DT) based interpolation (implemented by MATLAB function griddata) to generate the starting pointˆxpointˆpointˆx <ref type="bibr">(0)</ref> . Three reconstruction schemes are compared: Delaunay-triangle (DT) based interpolation (starting point of Algorithm 1), kernel-regression (KR) based interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Alg. 1. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> includes the comparison for four images: two edge-dominated and the other two texture-abundant. It can be observed that our work dramatically outperforms other competing schemes (the average PSNR gain is over 4dB) especially on texture images whose nonlocal dependency can not be effectively characterized by local models.</p><p>Figs. 6 and 7 include the comparison of reconstructed images for two generic images: house (edge-abundant) and lena (mixture of regular edges and irregular textures). Similar to the experimental setup in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, we have chosen sampling matrix S to randomly keep 15% pixels in the original image. We observe that the PSNR performance improvement for lena is less impressive than that for house due to the presence of irregular texture patterns. However, the visual quality of reconstructed image by patch-based nonlocal interpolation appears to be the highest (fewer artifacts). When measured by a recently proposed objective image quality metric named SSIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, we have found the PN scheme achieves the best results and the gain becomes even more noticeable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V-B. Compressive Imaging</head><p>For compressive imaging application, we first demonstrate how optimizing the randomness of sampling pattern S by Alg. improves the performance of Alg. 1. The starting point of Alg. 2 (S0) is obtained by randomly choosing (100 · λ)% locations from the sampling lattice of a given image as the location of events {s i }. It is known such strategy is only sufficient for 1D; for instance, the outcome in 2D often demonstrates structures (e.g., clumps, constellations as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 9a</ref>). Note that Alg. 2 can work any definition of randomness measure. In our implementation, we have adopted a combination of quadratbased and distance-based measures.</p><p>To illustrate the behavior of Alg. 2, we have taken an example of λ = 0.0625 on a 64×64 lattice. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 8</ref> includes the evolution of randomness measure for the first 2000 iterations. The initial condition S 0 and final result S 2 000 are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 9a</ref>. Even visual inspection can easily verify that the sampling pattern after optimization appears more random. The PSNR gain brought by such randomness optimization is dramatic as can be seen from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 9b</ref>. We note that such significant benefit of randomizing the sampling locations has clearly been harvested by human eyes as the result of evolution (refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for an image of spatially randomly-distributed rod/cone cells).</p><p>We have designed a batch of randomness-optimized sampling patterns with various λ's for image coding system of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. The quantization in our system is the simplest uniform quantization with an adjustable stepsize Q (intensity values at sampled locations are simply treated as a 1D signal and fit to a finite mixture of Gaussian models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>). In our preliminary study, we have fixed Q = 8 and compared the R-D performance with the popular wavelet-based SPIHT scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Figs. 10 and 11 include the comparison between our system and SPIHT for two test images: λ = 0.0625 for the edge image and λ = 0.25 for the texture image. Both images are compressed at the same bit rate to have a fair comparison. The superiority of our system on texture image is apparent (this is not surprising because it is long known that localized wavelet bases are not optimal for representing textures). For edge image, our system a) <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Illustration of how more randomness in sampling renders better reconstruction. a) original image; b),d),f) three different sampling patterns S 1 , S 2 , S 3 ; c),e),g) reconstructed images from S 1 , S 2 , S 3 .  have achieved noticeably better subjective quality (e.g., fewer artifacts). Note that ours is 1dB worse than SPIHT in terms of PSNR but more favorable on SSIM metric which has shown to better correlate with subjective results. Last, we want to demonstrate the error resilience of our coding system. To simulate the channel impairments, we assume only a subset of the samples at the locations {s i } are successfully received. If the error rate p ≥ 0 denotes the percentage of lost samples, Alg. 1 at the decoder simply work with a Poisson process with intensity parameter λ − p. For each error rate, we generate 10 independent error patterns and take the average PSNR value as the final result. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> shows the PSNR profile as p gradually increases and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 13</ref> contains several examples of decoded images at different error rates. The graceful degradation of both objective and subjective qualities justifies the insensitivity of our coding system.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">b) c) d) e) f) g)</formula></div>
