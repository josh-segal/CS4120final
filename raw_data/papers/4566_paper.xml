				<p>Question classification plays an important role in question-answering systems. Chinese question classification is the process that analyzes a question and labels it based on its question type and expected answer type. In this paper, we propose an integrated knowledge-based and machine learning approach for Chinese question classification that focuses on factoid question answering. We develop a Chinese question classification scheme for CLQA CC (Cross Language Question Answering Chinese to Chinese) factoid question answering, and define a coarse-grained and fine-grained classification taxonomy for a Chinese question-answering system. We adopt INFOMAP inference engine to support the knowledge-based approach for Chinese questions, which can be formulated as templates and use SVM (Support Vector Machines) as the machine learning approach for large collections of labeled Chinese questions. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of Chinese question classification using INFOMAP alone is 88%, and 73.5% with SVM alone. In contrast, classification based on a hybrid approach that incorporates SVM and INFOMAP yields an accuracy rate of 92%.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Question classification plays an important role in automated question-answering systems, such as those created for the TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) question answering task and NTCIR CLQA (Cross Language Question Answering). In general question answering systems, 36.4% of the errors occur in the question classification module for the derivation of the expected answer type <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The goal of question classification is to accurately classify a question into a question type and then map it to an expected answer type (question type determination) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For example, Chinese question classification for "奧運的發源地在哪裡？ (Where is the originating place of the Olympics?)" (question) is "Q_LOCATION| 地 " (question type). Question types derived from question classification can be used for answer extraction and answer filtering to improve the accuracy of the overall question answering system.</p><p>Approaches to question classification (QC) can be considered in two broad classes, namely, rule-based and statistical <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. In a rule-based approach, a domain expert produces a number of regular expressions and keywords. In a statistical (probabilistic) approach, on the other hand, the expert knowledge is replaced by a sufficiently large collection of labeled questions and a model is trained with the hope that the useful patterns for classification with the automatically capture. The statistical approach no only has the advantage of saving on expensive expert labor, but also has easier portability to other domains.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an integrated knowledge-based and machine learning approach for Chinese question classification (CQC) with the focus on factoid questionanswering in Chinese. CQC is the process that analyzes a question and labels the question based on its question type and expected answer type.</p><p>We adopt INFOMAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> as the knowledge-based approach for Chinese questions, which can be formulated as templates and use SVM (Support Vector Machines) as the machine learning approach for a large collection of labeled Chinese questions.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed approach. Section 3 discusses the experimental results. In Section 4, we compare our approach with related works. Finally, in Section 5, we present our conclusions and the directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROPOSED APPROACH</head><p>Question classification is the process of categorizing questions into semantic question types. Here, only CLQAstyle open domain factoid questions are considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Chinese Question Taxonomy</head><p>The first step in Chinese Question Classification (CQC) is to design a taxonomy of question types <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. A taxonomy can have a flat or hierarchical, and it can comprise a small (10-30) or large number of categories (above 50). After analyzing 500 questions taken from the development data set of CLQA provided by NTCIT and thousands of questions in the TREC question corpus, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of CQC for CLQA.</p><p>We have developed a hierarchical classification for Chinese questions using a two-layer hierarchical classification scheme (Question Type; QType) that corresponds to finegrained named entities or expected answer type (EAT). A fine-grained question type facilitates our question answeringsystem by extracting an answer based on the corresponding answer type of the named entity from the candidate sentences.</p><p>Having developed a hierarchical classification for Chinese questions, we define a coarse-grained and fine-grained classification taxonomy for a Chinese question-answering system. The proposed hierarchical classification taxonomy is inspired by the two-layered question taxonomy proposed in Li and Roth <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which contains 6 coarse-grained and 50 finegrained categories.</p><p>Our proposed taxonomy for CQC includes 6 coarse-grained classes (Q_PERSON| 人 , Q_LOCATION| 地 , Q_ORGANIZATION|組織, Q_ARTIFACT|物, Q_TIME|時 間 and Q_NUMBER| 數 值 ) and 62 fine grained-class, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Each coarse-grained category contains a non-overlapping set of fine-grained categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Question Type Filter for Expected Answer Type (EAT)</head><p>We have also developed a mapping method to obtain the expected answer type (EAT) from the question type (QType) classified by CQC. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the partial question type filter for the expected answer type.</p><p>The default EAT is denoted with an "*" in the beginning of the QType, which indicates that EAT focuses on the category and its sub categories, while EAT without an "*" indicates the coarse category is also a candidate EAT. For example, the EAT for fine-grained QTpye "Q_LOCATION_CITY|城市" is "LOCATION_CITY|城市", which indicate that the fine grained EAT and its coarse-grained EAT "Q_LOCATION| 地" are both candidate EATs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. INFOMAP (Knowledge-based Approach)</head><p>We adopt INFOMAP as the knowledge-based approach for CQC. INFOMAP is a knowledge representation framework that extracts important concepts from a natural language text <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. A powerful feature of INFOMAP is its capability to represent and match complicated template structures, such as hierarchical matching, regular expressions, semantic template matching, frame (non-linear relations) matching, and graph matching. Using INFOMAP, we can identify the question category from a Chinese question. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the knowledge representation for CQC in INFOMAP, which is described below. The two-layer question taxonomy is created in a hierarchical format. For example, the fine-grained category "Q_LOCATION_CITY|城市" is a sub node of the coarse-grained category "Q_LOCATION| 地 " represented in INFOMAP. There are two function nodes, "HAS-PART" and "Rule", in each coarse-grained and finegrained concept node.</p><p>For example, the knowledge representation of the question "2004 年奧運在哪一個城市舉行?(In which city were the Olympics held in 2004?)" in INFOMAP can be formulated as a rule or template like "[5 Time]:[3 Organization]:[7 Q_Location]: ([9 LocaitonRelatedEvent])". We create the rule in the "Rule" function node in INFOMAP. There are four elements (denoted as "HAS-PART") in this rule. <ref type="bibr">Thus, "2004</ref><ref type="bibr">年 (Year 2004</ref>)" is an instance of "Time", " 奧 運 (the Olympics)" is an instance of "Organization", "在哪一個城市 (in which city)" is an instance of "Location", "舉行(is held)" is an instance of "LocationRelatedEvent". After completing the knowledge representation of CQC in INFOMAP, we use the INFOMAP engine to process the Chinese question and determine the question type. For example, after the INFOMAP engine processes the question "2004 年奧運在哪一個城市舉行? (In which city were the Olympics held in 2004?)" it obtains the corresponding concept node fine-grained category "Q_LOCATION_CITY| 城 市 ", which indicates the question type. We use the mapping table presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> to get the expected answer type from the question type classified by CQC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. SVM (Machine Learning Approach)</head><p>We adopt SVM as the machine learning approach for CQC, motivated by the fact that they have consistently outperformed other machine learning techniques in several tasks, including text classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> and question classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>For the implementation of the machine learning approach, we use SVMlight <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for CQC. SVMlight is an implementation of Vapnik's Support Vector Machine for pattern recognition.</p><p>The two types of feature used in CQC are syntactic features and semantic features, which we describe below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Syntactic features</head><p>We use two syntactic features in our SVM model, bag-of words (ngram) and part-of-speech (POS).  We use AUTOTAG <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a POS tagger developed by CKIP, Academia Sinica, to get the POS of given Chinese questions, and then use the POS features for CQC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Semantic Features</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>񮽙 HowNet Senses</head><p>We use "HowNet 2000" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to get the semantic features of given Chinese questions. There are two semantic features used in our SVM Model, namely, HowNet Main Definition (HNMD) and HowNet Definition (HND).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Integration of SVM and INFOMAP (Hybrid Approach)</head><p>In from SVM and one question type obtained from INFOMAP, which is not the same as the one from SVM, we choose the one from SVM with a high positive score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Datasets</head><p>We use the CLQA's development dataset and formal run test dataset, respectively, for our training and testing of CQC. There are 300 questions for Japanese news and 200 for traditional Chinese news in development dataset. We manually build another 850 questions (518 in SVM and 332 questions in INFOMAP) for our proposed question taxonomy to train our CQC model. Note that we use different features to train the SVM model based on a total of 1350 questions and their labeled question type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Experimental Results</head><p>The experimental results of integrating knowledge-based and machine learning approach for CQC are presented below. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the experimental results of the machine learning approach for CQC. In this experiment, the training and testing data is taken from the development dataset provided by CLQA. Specifically, the training data is taken from CLQAS300 (300 questions for Japanese news), and the testing data is taken from CLQAS200 (200 questions for Chinese news). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the experimental results of different features used in SVM. The experimental results show that the character-based bigram (CB) and HowNet main definition (HNMD) features and the combination of CB and HNMD achieve better performance than the other features, which are also shown in the <ref type="figure">figure.</ref> For example, the CQC for the question "請問首位自費太 空旅行的觀光客為誰？(Who was the first self-financed space tourist?)" is "Q_PERSON_FIRSTPERSON|第一人", which is the top question type with the highest score obtained from SVM model.</p><p>We use the 1350 questions as our training dataset and the CB+HNMD features to train our SVM model for the testing dataset, which is taken from CLQA's formal run of 200 questions. The experimental results are as follows.</p><p>The accuracy of CQC using INFOMAP solely is 88% (176/200). There are 181 (90.5%) questions with answers from INFOMAP. The accuracy is 97% for the 181 questions with answer from INFOMAP. The accuracy of CQC with SVM (where the question is taken from those not answered by INFOMAP) is 42% <ref type="bibr">(8/19)</ref>. In addition, the accuracy of the CQC using SVM solely is 73.5% (147/200). However, it is significant that by integrating the SVM and INFOMAP (Hybrid Approach), the accuracy rate increases to 92% (184/200). The experimental results of the hybrid approach for CQC are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Discussion</head><p>Our experimental results indicate that the integrated approach performs better than the individual knowledgebased or machine learning approach. In addition, we want to assess the performance of the knowledge-based and machine learning approaches for different level of questions (in terms of easy and hard questions).</p><p>Easy questions are defined as follows: We now analyze the performance of the hierarchical coarse-grained and fine-grained question taxonomy in the integrated model. A total of 36% (68/200) of the questions can be classified into fine-grained categories, and 43% can be classified into the PERSON (Q_PERSON|人) coarse-grained category. In contrast, 63% of the questions that are not in the PERSON (Q_PERSON|人) coarse-grained category can be classified into fine-grained categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RELATED WORKS</head><p>Extensive works on question classification have been reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Early works suggested various standards for question classifications. Recent studies show that semantically classifying questions achieve a better result for factoid question-answering than conceptual categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Although multi-layered taxonomies have been proposed in the literature, most question classification studies are based on machine learning approaches.</p><p>Li and Roth <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposed 6 coarse classes and 50 fine classes for TREC factoid question answering. They use the Sparse Network of Windows (SNoW) with over 90% accuracy.</p><p>Zhang and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with only surface text features (bag-of-words and bag-ofngrams) and derive coarse-grained categories with 86% accuracy and fine-grained categories with approximately 80% accuracy. By adding syntactic information which including sub-trees of the parse tree that has at least one terminal symbol or one production rule, they derive an accuracy of 90% for coarse-grained classes. There are no results for finegrained classes.</p><p>Suzuki et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> use a hierarchical SVM to experiment on four feature sets: (1) words only; (2) words and named entities; (3) words and semantic information; and (4) words and NEs and semantic information. They measured a question type hierarchy at different depths and achieved accuracy rate ranging from 95% at depth 1 to 75% at depth 4.</p><p>In contract to our proposed approach for question classification in Chinese, the accuracy of CQC using INFOMAP solely is 88% and SVM solely is 73.5%, however, it is significant that by integrating the SVM and INFOMAP (Hybrid Approach) yields an accuracy rate of 92%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have proposed a hybrid approach to Chinese question classification (CQC) for CLQA factoid question-answering with hierarchical coarse-grained and fine-grained question taxonomies.</p><p>We have also developed a hierarchical classification containing 6 coarse-grained categories and 62 fine-grained categories for Chinese questions. Our proposed Chinese question type categories are designed for CLQA factoid questions. Furthermore, we propose a mapping method for question type filtering to obtain expected answer types (EAT), which can used to restrict the answers to factoid questions.</p><p>The most significant contribution of this paper is the integrated knowledge-based and machine learning approach, which achieves significantly better accuracy rate than individual approaches. Specifically, the accuracy of CQC that incorporates SVM and INFOMAP (our hybrid approach) is 92%, compared to 88% for INFOMAP solely and 73.5% for SVM solely. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.

(e.g., "誰 (Who)", "哪一位(Which person)", "首位(the first person)") 2. There are explicit words that identify the question type. If words are easy to identify, it means they overlap with a question type (For example, "隊伍(team)" and "運動隊伍 (sports team)") 3. There are interrogative words that connect with question type words in question. (For example, " 那個人(Which Person)").
