				<p>This paper examines graph-theoretic properties of existing peer-to-peer architectures and proposes a new infrastructure based on optimal-diameter de Bruijn graphs. Since generalized de Bruijn graphs possess very short average routing distances and high resilience to node failure, they are well suited for structured peer-to-peer networks. Using the example of Chord, CAN, and de Bruijn, we first study routing performance, graph expansion, and clustering properties of each graph. We then examine bisection width, path overlap , and several other properties that affect routing and resilience of peer-to-peer networks. Having confirmed that de Bruijn graphs offer the best diameter and highest connec-tivity among the existing peer-to-peer structures, we offer a very simple incremental building process that preserves optimal properties of de Bruijn graphs under uniform user joins/departures. We call the combined peer-to-peer architecture ODRI-Optimal Diameter Routing Infrastructure.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the last few years, peer-to-peer networks have rapidly evolved and have become an important part of the existing Internet culture. All current peer-to-peer proposals are built using application-layer overlays, each with a set of graph-theoretic properties that determine its routing efficiency and resilience to node failure. Graphs in peer-to-peer networks range from star-like trees (centralized approaches such as Napster) to complex k-node-connected graphs (such as Chord <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, CAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and Pastry <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>). The performance of each peer-to-peer architecture is determined by the properties of these graphs, which typically possess Θ(logN ) diameter and Θ(logN ) degree at each node (where N is the number of peers in the system). Until recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, understanding whether these bounds were optimal and whether there existed fixed-degree graphs with logN diameter was believed to be the fundamental question of peer-topeer research <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Besides the diameter and degree, a third very important property of a peer-to-peer structure is its resilience to simultaneous node failure. Without fault resilience, the answer to logarithmic routing in fixed-degree networks is obvious and includes a variety of simple tree-like structures. Thus, the main goal of this work is to find a fixed-degree graph with not only provably minimum diameter, but also maximum connectivity (i.e., fault resilience) among all such graphs.</p><p>Another dimension to this work is to provide a unifying analytical framework for understanding the various properties of existing and future peer-to-peer graphs. Many of the existing proposals (e.g., CAN, Chord, Pastry) have not been modeled in ways that can provide a clear quantitative assessment of each graph's resilience to node failure. In addition to these classical approaches, there are proposals based on heuristics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>) with no provablyoptimal underlying foundation for choosing one or another graph structure. Our work supplements such proposals with a more fundamental insight into the problem and offers analytical tools for evaluating future peer-to-peer routing architectures.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. We first examine the problem of obtaining logarithmic routing diameter in fixeddegree (sparse) graphs. Our work relies on generalized de Bruijn graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> of fixed degree k and asymptotically optimal diameter log k N . However, since the diameter itself does not tell the whole story, we also study the average distances between all pairs of nodes since this metric (rather than the diameter) determines the expected response time (i.e., number of hops) and the capacity of the peer-to-peer network.</p><p>We next examine clustering and small-world properties of each graph and explain how they relate to graph expansion. We derive that de Bruijn graphs have an order of magnitude smaller clustering coefficients than Chord, which explains the differences in expansion, resilience, and diameter between the two graphs. We then study the resilience of these graphs against node failure, or simply their connectivity. In general, connectivity determines the number and location of failures that a graph can tolerate without becoming disconnected. We examine edge bisection width in each graph and demonstrate that de Bruijn graphs are several times more difficult to disconnect than the traditional approaches. We also examine the amount of overlap between alternative (parallel) paths leading to any given destination and investigate how it affects the success of greedy routing under adversarial node failure.</p><p>Having confirmed that de Bruijn graphs offer a resilient and diameter-optimal routing structure, we provide an algorithm for building such graphs incrementally as peer nodes join and leave the system. We conclude the paper by showing that under uniform user joins, the diameter of the peerto-peer graph remains asymptotically optimal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND</head><p>Many current peer-to-peer networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> are based on distributed hash tables (DHTs), which provide a decentralized, many-to-one mapping between user objects and peers. This mapping is accomplished by organizing the peers in some virtual coordinate space and hashing each object to these virtual coordinates. The information about each object (such as the IP address of the owner) is kept by the peer to whose coordinates the object hashes. Their distributed structure, excellent scalability, short routing distances, and failure resilience make DHTs highly suitable for peer-to-peer networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Peer-to-Peer DHTs</head><p>Many current DHTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> rely on the concept of prefix-based routing introduced by <ref type="bibr">Plaxton et al.</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Plaxton's framework is extended in Tapestry <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Bayeux [17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> to accommodate dynamic join/departure of peers and provide necessary failure-recovery mechanisms. A similar method based on generalized hypercubes (Pastry) is shown by <ref type="bibr">Rowstron et al. in [35]</ref>. Using an alphabet of size b, Pastry builds a k-regular graph with diameter log b N and node degree (b − 1) log b N, b ≥ 2. Among other approaches, Ratnasamy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> propose a peer-to-peer architecture called Content-Addressable Network (CAN) that maps the DHT to a d-dimensional Cartesian space. CAN's diameter is 1 /2dN 1/d and the degree of each node is 2d. <ref type="bibr">Stoica et al. [40]</ref> propose a distributed graph called Chord, which uses a 1D modulo field (ring) with the diameter and degree both equal to log2N .</p><p>Recent proposals start to address the issue of routing in logarithmic time in fixed-degree graphs. For example, Considine et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> expand on Chord's ring structure by constructing a digraph (directed graph) of fixed degree; however, the proposed structure needs to estimate the number of active nodes to properly build the application-layer graph. Among tree-based structures, Freedman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> propose a DHT based on distributed tries and Tran et al.</p><p>[41] organize peers into a multicast tree of degree O(k 2 ) and diameter O(log k N ). <ref type="bibr">Xu et al.</ref> [42] study diameter-degree tradeoffs of current DHTs and propose a graph based on a modified static butterfly. As of this writing, the details of this framework are still under on-going investigation. Another peer-to-peer architecture based on butterfly networks (Viceroy) is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Independently of this work, several recent papers have also proposed de Bruijn graphs for peer-to-peer networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. These developments are complementary to our investigation and provide implementation details and additional analysis not covered in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Fault Tolerance of DHTs</head><p>Fault tolerance of peer-to-peer networks is an equally important topic. Liben-Nowell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> examine error resilience dynamics of Chord when nodes join/leave the system and derive lower bounds on the degree necessary to maintain a connected graph with high probability. Fiat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> build a Censorship Resistant Network that can tolerate massive adversarial node failures and random object deletions. <ref type="bibr">Saia et al. [36]</ref> create another highly fault-resilient structure with O(log 3 N ) state at each node and O(log 3 N ) permessage routing overhead. Unfortunately, very few studies examine the resilience of existing graphs in comparison with each other or attempt to understand whether this resilience can be improved while preserving the diameter and routing overhead of the graph. We are aware of only one comparison study, in which Gummadi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> find that ring-based graphs (such as Chord) offer more flexibility with route selection and provide better performance under random node failure compared to several other traditional DHTs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Random Graphs</head><p>Another direction for building DHTs relies on properties of random graphs. The main thrust in this area is to build logarithmic-time routing structures with constant degree. Pandurangan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> propose a random DHT graph with a constant degree and (almost certainly) logarithmic diameter; however, the paper does not provide an efficient routing algorithm for the proposed structure that can deterministically explore the low diameter of the graph. Aspnes et al.</p><p>[1] examine random graphs of fixed degree l + 1 and derive upper and lower bounds on the expected routing distance in such graphs. Their results show that both bounds are proportional to ln 2 N l ln ln N . Law et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> build random expander graphs based on Hamiltonian cycles with O(logN ) diameter and O(logN ) degree.</p><p>Even though random graphs of logarithmic diameter can be built with high probability using random neighbor selection, the design of efficient routing algorithms competitive to those in deterministic graphs is still an open issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Optimal-Diameter Graphs</head><p>The problem of designing an optimal-diameter graph of fixed degree has been extensively studied in the past. In one formulation of this problem, assume a graph of fixed degree k and diameter D (the maximum distance between any two nodes in the graph). What is the maximum number of nodes N that can be packed into any such graph? A wellknown result is the Moore bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N ≤ 1 + k + k 2 + ... + k D = k D+1 − 1 k − 1 = N M .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Interestingly, Moore bound NM is only achievable for trivial values of k and D. In fact, the Moore bound is provably not achievable for any non-trivial graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Directed de Bruijn graphs come close to the Moore bound and can be built with N = k D nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> or even with N = k D + k D−1 nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In general, it is not known how close we can approach upper bound NM for non-trivial graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In the context of peer-to-peer DHTs, we are concerned with a different formulation of the problem: given N nodes and fixed degree k, what is the minimum diameter in any graph built on top of these N nodes? The answer follows from (1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D ≥ log k (N (k − 1) + 1) − 1 = D M .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Imase and Itoh <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> construct nearly optimal de Bruijn graphs of diameter D = log k N , which is at most DM + 1; however, for large k, the two diameters become asymptotically equal. In this paper, we use the same basic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> even though they can be slightly improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Another very important metric related to the routing performance of a graph is its average distance µ d between every pair of nodes (note that we include distances from a node to itself in µ d while some of the related work does not). The lower bound on µ d in any k-regular graph is given by the average distance in the corresponding Moore graph and is also not achievable for non-trivial values of N and k <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">µ d ≥ D M − k(k D M − 1) N (k − 1) 2 + DM N (k − 1) ≈ D M − 1 k − 1 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>With respect to µ d , de Bruijn graphs are again asymptotically optimal and converge to the bound in (3) for sufficiently large N and k <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Motivation</head><p>One of the goals of this work is to build a distributed hash table (DHT) on top of fixed-degree graphs with provably optimal routing diameter. Since non-trivial Moore graphs do not exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we use de Bruijn graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> of diameter log k N and often call them "optimal" since among the class of practically achievable graphs with simple routing rules, they are optimal. To illustrate the impressive reduction in diameter compared to the classical DHT structures, assume 1 million nodes and degree k fixed at log 2 N = 20. Under these circumstances, Chord offers a graph with diameter D equal to log 2 N = 20, while a de Bruijn graph with the same number of neighbors has a diameter four times smaller: D = log 20 N = 4.61 = 5. Note that the diameter of the corresponding Moore graph is essentially the same: D M = 4.59 = 5.</p><p>Throughout the paper, we are concerned with the properties of the underlying graph of each peer-to-peer network. Consequently, we examine the diameter and resilience of these graphs assuming that the hashing function equally spreads users along the DHT space and that all graphs are populated with the maximum number of nodes (this assumption is relaxed in section 7). We further assume for simplicity of notation that the total number of nodes N is a power of node degree and omit ceiling functions whenever appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Structure of de Bruijn Graphs</head><p>De Bruijn graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> are nearly optimal, fixed-degree digraphs of diameter log k N , where k is the fixed degree of each node and N is the total number of nodes. Note that de Bruijn graphs are directed graphs with k outgoing and k incoming edges at each node, which also holds for many other protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Assume that each node x is hashed to a string Hx drawn from some alphabet Σ of size k. For example, if k is two, then H x is a binary string of 0s and 1s. A directed de Bruijn graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> contains N = k D nodes where D is the diameter of the graph. Each node Hx in the graph is a string (h1, . . . , hD) of length D linked to k other nodes (h 2 , . . . , h D , α), for all possible α ∈ Σ. A classical de Bruijn graph for k = 2 and N = 8 is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (left) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The diameter of the graph in the figure is 3, even though some nodes link to themselves. In fact, de Bruijn graphs contain exactly k nodes (h, h,. . . , h), for all h ∈ Σ, which link to themselves (this makes the graph irregular). It is possible to create a regular de Bruijn graph by linking these nodes to each other for added failure resilience. We discuss this in section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Routing</head><p>Recall that shortest-path routing between any two nodes in de Bruijn networks follows a greedy procedure executed by individual nodes in a distributed fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Assume that node x seeks a shortest path to node y. The choice of the next-hop neighbor follows a simple string-matching algorithm shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (right)</ref>. Node x finds the longest overlap between the suffix of its hash index H x and the prefix of y's hash index H y . In the figure, the longest overlap, labeled B, contains (D − i) digits, for some i. By merging prefix A, overlap B, and suffix C, node x can generate the entire path P to reach y. Notice that P starts with Hx, ends with H y , and contains no more than (D − 1) intermediate nodes (each node is a D-character substring of P , read from left to right). As an example, again consider the graph in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (left). Suppose node 001 needs to route to node 101 along the shortest path. Using the above procedure, prefix A is 00, overlap B is 1, and suffix C is 01. The resulting shortest path is P = 00101, which translates to 001→010 →101.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Comparison with Existing Graphs</head><p>In this section, we briefly examine diameter-degree tradeoffs of the existing protocols and compare them to those of de Bruijn graphs. We leave a thorough analysis of numerous recently proposed graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> for future work and conduct a detailed study of two classical approaches Chord <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and CAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> in sections 4-6. This section also shows results for Pastry and the static butterfly graph (without detailed analysis) and all together omits Tapestry since its diameter-degree tradeoff is very similar</p></div>

Therefore, as we discuss below, the individual diameter-degree tradeoffs of these approaches are different from that in the classic graph. We further remove all fault-resilient additions of each structure (such as the predecessor pointer and r-element successor list in Chord) and only analyze the "raw" performance of each graph.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D de Bruijn k log k N Trie k+1 2log k N Chord log2N log2N CAN 2d 1 /2dN 1/d Pastry (b−1)log b N log b N Classic butterfly k 2 log k N (1 − o(1))</formula><p>As an illustration of fixed-degree tree structures, we also examine k-ary tries as they have been recently proposed for DHTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A k-ary trie uses prefix-based routing over a tree where each parent maintains k children, one child for each symbol in the alphabet. Consequently, the maximum degree of any node in the trie is k + 1 and the diameter of the graph is 2 log k N (i.e., the distance to the root and back).</p><p>Finally, recall that the traditional butterfly network contains N = mk m nodes (where k is again the degree of each node) and has diameter D = 2m-1. Notice that D can be expressed in terms of degree k using Lambert's function W <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">D = 2m − 1 = 2 W (N ln k) ln k − 1 = 2 log k N (1 − o(1)). (4)</formula><p>Even though butterflies are appealing graphs, there are non-trivial difficulties in building them as nodes join and leave the system. In one example, Viceroy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> implements a binary butterfly with diameter 3log 2 N and degree 7 and further requires estimation of the number of nodes in the system. In another example, Ulysses <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> adds logN neighbors to each node and is no longer a fixed-degree graph. As we show in section 7, distributed de Bruijn graphs possess no more conceptual complexity than Chord, achieve optimal diameter in the peer-to-peer graph, and can be built with a fixed application-layer degree. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows asymptotic diameter and node degree of de Bruijn graphs and several existing (deterministic) structures. First note that we assume that CAN uses circular (toroidal) routing in each of the dimensions, which means that all nodes along the borders maintain 2d neighbors and that the CAN graph is regular. Second, Chord allows a generalization to d log 2 N neighbors and diameter log 1+d N <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>; however, it is most frequently used with the default value of d = 1 shown in the table (which is also the version studied in this paper). Finally, the trie maintains its average degree over all nodes equal to only 2 (since approximately k−1 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Bruijn  butterfly  2  20  - - huge  - 31  3  13  40  - - - 20  4  10  26  - 1,000  - 16  10  6  13  - 40  - 10  20  5  10  20  20  20  8  50  4  8  - - 7  7  100</ref> 3 6 --5 5 <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Graph diameter for N = 10 6 (cells with a dash indicate that the graph does not support the corresponding node degree).</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">k 1 Strictly speaking, Tapestry's routing table size is b log b N instead of (b − 1) log b N [43]. k de Trie Chord CAN Pastry Classic</formula><p>fraction of the nodes are leaves); however, the imbalance in the middle of the tree with nodes of degree k + 1 creates a rather pessimistic diameter-degree tradeoff.</p><p>We next examine the performance of these graphs in a hypothetical peer-to-peer system of N = 10 6 nodes. <ref type="table">Table  2</ref> shows the diameter of each graph as a function of its degree k. Notice that for low-degree networks <ref type="bibr">(k ≤ 20)</ref>, even the trie offers a better diameter than the three classical approaches (i.e., CAN, Chord, and Pastry). In fact, the trie routes in half the time compared to Chord or CAN. Also notice that de Bruijn graphs with the same number of neighbors offer diameters at least four times smaller than those in Chord and CAN. Furthermore, de Bruijn graphs can route between any pair of nodes in 20 hops with only 2 neighbors, which is 10 times less than that required by CAN, Chord, or Pastry to achieve the same diameter. Finally, the traditional butterfly offers a diameter approximately 50-60% larger than that in de Bruijn graphs for all values of k.</p><p>One interesting observation about CAN points to the fact that selection of the number of dimensions d is an important decision for a given number of nodes N . It is noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> that d is likely to be fixed while N changes; however, as <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows, many small values of d log 2 N result in greatly suboptimal diameters. This observation is easy to explain since CAN's diameter 1 /2dN 1/d is a strictly convex function with a unique minimum located at d = lnN (e peers per dimension). Keeping in mind that each dimension must contain an integer number of peers, the best practical diameter is achieved for d = log 3 N . Thus, for N = 10 6 , the optimal number of dimensions d is 12 (k = 24 neighbors) and the optimal diameter is 19. Also note that when d = 1 /2 log 2 N , CAN's degree and diameter are both equal to that of Chord (this is shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> for k = 20 and also noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>).</p><p>Further examining <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, notice that Pastry offers a good diameter only for large b 2. In fact, to come within one hop of the optimal diameter for N = 10 6 , Pastry requires at least 160 neighbors (not shown in the table). Such large routing tables may be impractical in the real Internet due to high volume of traffic required to maintain peer-level connections and repair broken links when existing neighbors frequently fail. From this angle, bounded-degree graphs are preferable.</p><p>On the other hand, Pastry has an advantage over other structures in its ability to employ proximity-based peer selection. In theory, such graph construction is possible in Chord, CAN, and de Bruijn, but it requires a less-transparent implementation. Since the benefits of topologically aware peer-to-peer networks are hard to quantify with respect to other metrics, our current study only focuses on pure graph performance of each approach. Construction of topologically aware de Bruijn graphs is a possible topic for future investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ROUTING ANALYSIS</head><p>De Bruijn graphs have desirable properties for peer-topeer networks that stem from their small diameter. However, the diameter of a graph is simply the largest distance between any pair of nodes and only provides an upper bound on the delay (number of hops) experienced by the users. A much more balanced metric is the average distance between any pair of nodes since this is the performance a user can expect from the peer-to-peer system when searching for objects. In fact, it is possible to reduce the diameter of a graph and at the same time increase its average routing distance as was recently demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Define d(x,y) to be the shortest distance between nodes x and y in a given graph. To better understand how the distribution of d(x,y) is formed and study expansion properties of each graph, the full version of the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> first derives the density (mass) function of d(x,y) and then computes its expectation µ d .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Chord</head><p>Stoica et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> showed in simulation that the average inter-node distance µ d in Chord is D 2 and offered a simple explanation of why this happens. They further showed the distribution of d(x,y) to be bell-shaped as demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> (left) for N = 1,024. The histogram appears to be Gaussian as illustrated by an almost-perfect fit of a Gaussian distribution in the figure. It has been noted before that certain real-world graphs (such as those describing webpage linkage structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) exhibit Gaussian distributions of d(x,y), but no explanation of why this happens has been offered. Below, we analyze Chord's distribution of shortest distances, understand why it appears to be Gaussian, and provide additional qualitative insight into the structure of the graph using "small-world" terminology.</p><p>The following lemma is proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 1.

Our simulation results confirm that (5) gives the exact distribution of shortest path lengths in Chord. The expected value µ d of a binomial random variable is a well-known result and equals Dp, or simply D</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>. This provides an alternative derivation of the result previously shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>The reason why the distribution of shortest distances in Chord appears to be Gaussian is explained by the de MoivreLaplace theorem, which states that the binomial distribution in (5) asymptotically tends to a Gaussian distribution for sufficiently large D. Even though we have not provided an insight into why certain Internet graphs exhibit Gaussian distributions of shortest paths, we found a clear explanation of this phenomenon in Chord.</p><p>There is also a simple intuitive link between the bell shape of the curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> (left) and the expansion properties of the graph. As the distance from any given node x increases, the number of new neighbors found by the search slowly saturates and starts declining after half the nodes have been reached. This means that many of the newly found nodes link to some of the previously discovered nodes. This leads to a situation where the new neighbors "know" many of the old neighbors, which is often called the smallworld property (or clustering) of the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In graph theory, the growth in the number of new neighbors discovered at a certain distance is related to node expansion of the graph. Quickly expanding graphs maintain an exponentially increasing number of new neighbors up to the diameter of the graph, which means that very few of the new neighbors "know" the old ones (and hence their clustering coefficients are virtually zero). We study these phenomena more carefully in section 5, but currently conjecture that we should expect reasonably high clustering and low expansion from Chord.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">CAN</head><p>Recall that CAN organizes its nodes into a d-dimensional Cartesian space. We first examine the average distance in this graph and then show that for the same degree, CAN's distribution of routing distances becomes identical to that in Chord. The following result in proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and is mentioned for the even values of N in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Our next lemma shows that as the number of dimensions d increases, CAN's distribution of shortest paths becomes Gaussian as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Lemma 3. For large d, CAN's distribution of shortest distances p(n) is Gaussian.</formula><p>This lemma is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>   As noted in section 3.4, when d = 1 /2 log 2 N , CAN's degree and diameter are both log 2 N , or those of Chord. We call such CAN "logarithmic" and note that the size of its dimensions is N 1/d = 4 peers.</p><p>Lemma 4. The distribution of shortest distances in logarithmic CAN (d = 1 /2 log 2 N ) is binomial and identical to that in Chord.</p><p>The result of this lemma is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> (left) for N = 1,024, d = 5, and D = 10, which shows a perfect match between the two graphs (the distributions also match numerically). Note that the only problem that prevents CAN from "becoming" Chord is the difficulty of dynamically adjusting the number of dimensions d. Even though CAN offers more flexibility with the choice of d, the choice itself is very difficult as it must be made a-priori and can only rely on the expected number of nodes in the system. Small (fixed) values of d prevent the system from scaling to large N , while large values of d are inefficient in settings where N happens to be small. Therefore, it appears that in practical networks of non-trivial size, the ability to scale its degree dynamically provides Chord with a clear advantage over CAN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">De Bruijn</head><p>From the diameter perspective, de Bruijn graphs offer significantly smaller end-to-end upper bounds on routing time. However, the improvement by a factor of 4 over Chord for N = 10 6 no longer holds when we examine the average shortest distances in each graph. Nevertheless, the improvement in µ d is still substantial, but drops down to about a factor of two faster than Chord as we demonstrate below.</p><p>In general, the distribution of de Bruijn's distances d(x, y) is very complicated and there is no known closed-form expression for its PMF p(n) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. In the full version of the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we derive a simple formula for p(n) that is exact for all graphs of diameter D ≤ 3 and is very close to the real p(n) for the rest of the graphs.</p><p>Lemma 5. The asymptotic distribution of shortest distances in de Bruijn graphs is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p(n) ≈ k n N − k 2n−1 N 2 ≥ k n − k n−1 N .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>It immediately follows from the lemma that de Bruijn graphs expand exponentially and that the majority of nodes are reachable at shortest distance D from each node v. This  is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> (right), which shows de Bruijn's p(n) for N = 1,000 and k = 10 (note the log scale of the y-axis). Intuitively, it is clear that the average distance in de Bruijn graphs must be very close to diameter D and that the local structure of the graph at each node looks like a tree (i.e., very few short cycles and low clustering). We examine the cyclic structure of each graph in section 5 and in the meantime, focus on de Bruijn's average distance µ d .</p><p>Lemma 6. The average distance in de Bruijn graphs is asymptotically:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">µ d ≈ D − 1 k − 1 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>As expected, the average distance in de Bruijn graphs cannot shrink much beyond its already very small diameter D. In fact, for large values of N , the average distance µ d in (7) asymptotically tends to D as k becomes large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Butterfly</head><p>The final graph we examine in this section is the classic butterfly. Even though its diameter and average distance are close to optimal, they are always higher than those in (nontrivial) de Bruijn graphs. Recall that the average distance in the butterfly graph is given by the following <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">µ d = 3m − 1 2 − 1 k − 1 + m N (k − 1) ≈ 3 log k N 2 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>which, for large N and k, is asymptotically 50% larger than the same metric in de Bruijn graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Discussion</head><p>The results of this section indicate that de Bruijn graphs offer not only provably-optimal diameter D, but also smaller average routing times compared to Chord, CAN, and the static butterfly. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> for N = 10 6 , the average distance in de Bruijn graphs is still smaller than half of that in Chord and CAN for the same number of neighbors and 22% smaller than that in the butterfly. Also notice that for large k, µ d in de Bruijn graphs converges to the best possible average distance of Moore graphs shown in the first column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>This result has several practical implications. First, µ d determines the expected delay in the graph and represents a measure of responsiveness of the system to user searches. Second, the average distance determines the capacity of a peer-to-peer network, where the capacity is a term widely used in interconnection and wireless networks to define the throughput available to each node under random communication patterns within the network. Since each peer must forward requests for other peers, the expected useful capacity of a node is determined by the inverse of µ d (i.e., for each useful request a node makes, it must forward on average µ d other requests).</p><p>Assuming fixed transmission bandwidth and discounting interference effects, the average capacity c(G) of wireless ad-hoc networks is O( 1 / √ N ) due to spatial restrictions on connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, while both Chord and logarithmic CAN maintain an average capacity of 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">µ d = 2 log 2 N</formula><p>. Compared to wireless networks, this is a much better bound; however, it is still several times lower than that in de Bruijn graphs. Even assuming a worst-case average distance µ d = D in de Bruijn graphs, their average capacity with log 2 N neighbors is superior to Chord's for all N &gt; 16:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">c(G) = 1 log k N = log 2 log 2 N log 2 N .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>In fact, the ratio of these two capacities grows infinitely large (albeit very slowly) for large N . Compared to the static butterfly, de Bruijn graphs offer asymptotically 50% more capacity and at least 22% more capacity in graphs of practical size examined in this work.</p><p>In the current Internet, each search request typically carries a small amount of information and it is not clear at this point whether future peer-to-peer systems will be utilized to the point of their ultimate capacity. Nevertheless, we believe that it is desirable to design the underlying structure of the application-layer graph to be able to carry as many concurrent requests as possible. Thus, we must conclude that de Bruijn graphs offer clear benefits in terms of expected capacity and routing distances (delay) over the existing approaches.</p><p>There exists, however, one drawback of fixed-degree graphs based on the static butterfly and de Bruijn graphs. In both cases, edge load distribution is not uniform and results in some edges carrying more load (on average) than others. In addition, de Bruijn graphs demonstrate non-uniform node load distribution. This is a well-studied area in interconnection networks and there are many improvements to the routing protocols that can distribute the load in de Bruijn and butterfly networks more evenly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. We leave exploration of this direction for future work.</p><p>Next, we investigate clustering and then resilience features of de Bruijn graphs before addressing their practical use in peer-to-peer networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CLUSTERING AND EXPANSION</head><p>Following significant research effort to model the structure of the current Internet, it was discovered that many of the existing topology generators did not accurately match the "small-world" (clustering) properties of the Internet graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Clustering is a very interesting concept that is found in many natural phenomena and that determines how tightly neighbors of any given node link to each other. In what follows, we examine clustering in Chord, CAN, and de Bruijn graphs, study graph-theoretic semantics behind the clustering coefficient, and show why metrics related to clustering are important concepts for peer-to-peer systems.</p><p>Given graph G = (V, E), node v ∈ V , and its neighborhood Γ(v) = {u: (v,u) ∈ E}, clustering coefficient γ(v) is defined as the ratio of the number of links L(Γ(v)) that are entirely contained in Γ(v) to the maximum possible number of such links (if the graph is undirected, each link in L(Γ(v)) is counted twice):</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">γ(v) = L(Γ(v)) |Γ(v)|(|Γ(v)| − 1) .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Graph clustering γ(G) is the average of γ(v) for all vertices v with degree at least 2. The main questions that we study in this section are: what exactly does clustering mean and how does it affect the properties desirable in peer-to-peer networks?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Clustering Coefficients</head><p>We first present the values of clustering coefficients of all three graphs (for proofs, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>) and then explain the meaning of our results. Notice that de Bruijn's γ(G) decays to zero much quicker than Chord's confirming our earlier conjecture based on the distribution of shortest paths in section 4. The derivation of γ(G) for CAN is much simpler as one can easily notice that none of the nodes in any neighborhood link to each other. Hence, CAN's γ(G) is zero. This is somewhat counter-intuitive since CAN's number of new neighbors becomes saturated at D 2 just as in Chord and therefore its clustering properties should be similar to Chord's. We next examine the reasons behind this phenomenon and generalize clustering to become a global metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Cycles</head><p>There are two ways to better understand what clustering means and assess its importance for peer-to-peer networks. The first insight is based on cycles. Given a k-regular undirected graph G, it is easy to notice that the number of 3-cycles per node determines the clustering coefficient of the graph. Recall that an n-cycle is a path that starts and ends in the same node and contains exactly n edges 2 . Hence, any 3-cycle must involve two direct neighbors of node v, which results in clustering.</p><p>Since one goal in peer-to-peer networks is to reach as many nodes as possible within a certain number of hops, cycles that lead back to the original node where the request started are not very helpful. Another goal of peer-to-peer networks is to provide a fault-resilient environment where a simultaneous collapse of several nodes does not separate the graph into disjoint components. Short cycles mean that paths from any node x through different neighbors leading to any destination y must overlap with each other. This is not desirable since multiple parallel paths to y may be compromised when nodes in the neighborhood fail. This is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> (left) where failure of node 1 leaves x with no path leading outside of its neighborhood. In fact, when node 1 fails, nodes 2 and 3 are also disconnected from the rest of the graph since all of their outgoing (as well incoming) edges are locally clustered. Now we come back to the issue of why CAN has zero clustering, but identical shortest-path properties to those found in Chord. The absence of 3-cycles in CAN is explained by the fact that it has no odd cycles whatsoever, but it does have plenty of even cycles. In fact, the number of 4-cycles in CAN is roughly the same as in undirected Chord with the same number of neighbors. Consequently, local properties captured by the clustering coefficient do not necessarily mean much for graphs like CAN where only "friends of friends" have common acquaintances while direct friends of node x never know each other. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  4</ref> (right), where clustering coefficient γ(x) is zero, but nodes 2, 3, 4 all link to the same "friend of a friend" node 5.</p><p>The concept of n-cycles applies to directed graphs as well; however, it does not directly produce the clustering coefficient because of a stricter nature of directed cycles. These difficulties lead us to generalize the framework of clustering using expansion analysis below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Graph Expansion</head><p>Examine <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> (right), which shows how undirected 4-cycles contribute to a graph's global clustering properties. Global clustering is a concept of "friends knowing each other" generalized to "friends knowing each others' friends". Although the previous discussion of cycles allows one to account for these cases, we seek a more generic and useful definition of clustering that goes beyond n-cycles (n ≥ 3) and has a simple closed-form analytical expression for all three graphs.</p><p>We next study graph expansion, which determines how quickly the graph finds "unknown" nodes. Consider graph G = (V , E) and select some of its nodes into set S ⊂ V . Define the set of all edges between S and the rest of the graph V \S to be ∂S={(u, v):</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(u, v) ∈ E, u ∈ S, v ∈ V \S}.</formula><p>∂S is called the edge boundary of S. Edge expansion i(S) is defined as the ratio of the size of ∂S to the size of S:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">i(S) = |∂S| |S| .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>It is easy to see the relationship of i(S) to clustering. Select S to be the neighborhood Γ(v) of some node v. Therefore, |S| = k and the number of edges contained within S is k 2 − |∂S|, generically assuming a k-regular graph. Then the clustering coefficient of v is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">γ(v) = k 2 − |∂S| k(k − 1) = k 2 − i(Γ(v))k k(k − 1) = k − i(Γ(v)) k − 1 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Edge expansion determines the strength of the graph in the presence of edge failure. Clearly, a larger clustering coefficient in a k-regular graph implies smaller i(Γ(v)) as seen in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref> and generally leads to weaker graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1. Graph edge expansion (sometimes called the isoperimetric number of the graph) i(G) is the minimum of i(S) for all non-empty sets</head><formula xml:id="formula_17">S ⊂ V, |S| ≤ |V | 2 .</formula><p>Notice that by examining i(G), we no longer focus on local clustering, but rather on global properties of the graph and its resilience to edge failure over all possible sets S. Edge expansion tells us how many edges link outside any set S; however, it does not tell us if the outgoing edges link to the same node multiple times. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> (right), there are 8 edges leaving neighborhood Γ(x), but they link to only 4 unique nodes, which indicates a good amount of path overlap. Edge expansion tells us the size of the edge cut between Γ(x) and the rest of the graph, which is a useful analysis tool for studying a graph's resilience when edges are expected to fail (i.e., 8 edges in the cut are better than 4). In peer-to-peer systems, node failure is much more common than edge failure, in which case regardless of how many edges cross the cut, the strength of the neighborhood is determined by the number of nodes on the other side of ∂S. Hence, from the resilience perspective of peer-to-peer networks, it makes more sense to examine node expansion of the graph as we define below.</p><p>Definition 2. Consider graph G = (V, E) and some subset of nodes S ⊂ V . Define the node boundary of S to be ∂S = {v : (u, v) ∈ E, u ∈ S, v ∈ V \S}. Node expansion h(G) of the graph is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">h(G) = min {S:|S|≤|V |/2} |∂S| |S| .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Both i(G) and h(G) are related to edge and node bisection widths of the graph and generally are NP-complete problems. Furthermore, even after many years of research, the exact expression of these metrics for de Bruijn graphs remains unknown. Below, we limit our analysis to sets S that are neighborhoods of a given node (i.e., balls centered at the node) and study graph expansion that explains how well each ball is connected to the rest of the graph. Note that these balls do not necessarily represent the weakest sets S of each graph and do not, in general, achieve the minimum bound in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Derivation of better bounds on h(G) is the topic of on-going research.</p><p>Recall that ball B(v,n) of radius n centered at node v contains all nodes reachable from v in no more than n hops. In other words: B(v,n)={u: d(v,u) ≤ n}. It is easy to notice that the boundary of a ball is simply ∂B(v,n)={u: d(v,u) = n+1} and that our derivations in section 4 can be applied to study expansion (and global clustering) of each graph. Both logarithmic CAN and Chord have the same expansion properties since their distributions of d(x,y) are identical. Hence, from now on, we only consider Chord.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Lemma 9. Chord's ball expansion hB(G) is asymptoti- cally Θ( 1 / √ log 2 N )</formula><p>. This function slowly decays from 0.45 for N = 2,048 to 0.27 for N = 10 9 . Contrast this result with that in de Bruijn graphs below, which maintain constant connectivity h B (G) for all ball sizes and all values of N .</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Lemma 10. De Bruijn's ball expansion h B (G) is no less than k − 1.</formula><p>De Bruijn graphs expand so quickly, they actually approach the maximum possible bound on h B (G) and keep all balls B(v, n) connected to the rest of the graph through at least (k − 1)|B(v, n)| external nodes. In fact, this not only explains the low diameter of de Bruijn graphs, but also leads to two important results. First, clustering in de Bruijn graphs is minimal at both local and global levels since exponential neighborhood expansion is preserved for all balls smaller than the graph itself. Second, path overlap in the graph is virtually non-existent due to little global clustering. This means that shortest parallel paths towards any given destination are expected to be node-disjoint with high probability.</p><p>In the next section, we study fault resilience of these graphs and examine whether k-node-connectivity of each graph can always be exploited using greedy routing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Generic Methods</head><p>Classical failure analysis in peer-to-peer networks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>) focused on analyzing the probability that a given node x becomes disconnected under a p-percent node failure. This amounts to computing the probability that all k neighbors of x fail simultaneously and leads to very small individual failure probabilities p k for most practical networks. Also note that results derived using this method hold for any k-regular graph, regardless of its internal structure. Clearly, this analysis is insufficient to distinguish between all k-regular graphs since some of them may contain "weak" parts that can partition the graph into several disjoint components while no single node is completely disconnected from its component.</p><p>Another approach often used in classical fault resilience analysis is to examine k-node-connectivity of the graph in question. Given our graph structures, we show below that this metric does not lead to any significant insight either. This implies that a k-node-connected graph can tolerate the failure of any k−1 nodes without becoming disconnected and that the diameter of the graph after any k − 1 nodes have failed is at most D + 1. Both CAN and Chord are knode-connected 3 , while de Bruijn graphs are not due to several "weak" nodes with self-loops. This classical form of de Bruijn graphs has been shown to be (k−1)-node connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>; however, we seek to achieve maximum fault tolerance, which leads us to removing the loops and linking these k "weak" nodes to each other. Consider node (h,h,. . . ,h), h ∈ Σ, with a self-loop. A chain-linked de Bruijn graph has directed links (h,h,. . . ,h) → (g,g,. . . ,g), for all h ∈ Σ and g = (h + 1) mod k. Recent development in consecutived graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> also studied chain-linked de Bruijn graphs and proved that they are k-node connected.</p><p>What we know so far from classical peer-to-peer network analysis and maximum fault-tolerance metrics is that all three graphs are similar in their resilience. Hence, we seek additional methods that can distinguish between the fault tolerance offered by each graph. One such metric is bisection width <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which is defined as the smallest number of (possibly directed) edges between any two equal-size partitions of the graph. Graph bisection width determines the difficulty of splitting the graph into giant components by failing individual edges. We next examine this metric in all three graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Bisection Width</head><p>Note that besides determining resilience, bisection width of a graph often provides tight upper bounds on the achievable capacity of the graph. Assume that each node sends messages to random destinations at a certain fixed rate. This communication pattern generates N messages per time unit. Each message is replicated µ d times (on average) and each edge is expected to carry</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">N µ d N k = µ d k</formula><p>messages per time unit. Note, however, that this analysis assumes that the combined load is equally distributed between all edges. There may be bottlenecks in which the load is significantly higher than the average and the resulting throughput capacity of the graph may be lower than the expected (mean) value.</p><p>Recall that approximately half of all communication in the graph is expected to cross the bisection cut. Thus, if this part of the graph is narrow (contains only a few edges), it will lead to congestion and inability of the graph to carry its expected load. One example of graphs with unacceptably small bisection width are trees, which are susceptible to both easy disconnects and severe congestion near the root.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Lemma 11. Chord's bisection width bw(G) is N .</formula><p>Note that this value is double the bisection width of binary hypercubes since Chord uses directed links while hypercubes are undirected. . Furthermore, if we view undirected links of logarithmic CAN as being composed of two directed edges, its bisection width matches that of Chord. Also note that CAN achieves its maximum bw (G) when d = log 3 N and that all sub-logarithmic values of d log 2 N result in "weaker" graphs. This is another way of showing that CAN with small fixed values of d may not be competitive to Chord in practical settings.</p><p>The bisection width of the butterfly is kN 2m <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, where m is given by Lambert's function W in (4). Asymptotically, this bisection becomes kN 2 log k N , although for small N it is slightly better. Finally, the exact value of bw (G) of de Bruijn graphs is unknown and the best available upper and lower bounds differ by a factor of four <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">kN 2 log k N (1 − o(1)) ≤ bw(G) ≤ 2kN log k N (1 + o(1)).<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Using the lower bound in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref>, the bisection width of de Bruijn graphs for k = log 2 N is larger than that in Chord or CAN by a factor of 1 /2 log 2 log 2 N (which is 2.2 for N = 10 6 ) and is generally no worse than that in the butterfly. It is further conjectured that the actual bisection width of de Bruijn graphs is at least 40% higher than the pessimistic lower bound used in the above comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In summary, larger values of bisection width in de Bruijn graphs point towards higher resilience against graph partitioning and lower congestion in the bisection cut in addition to their optimal routing established earlier. Below, we examine several other resilience metrics that may lead to an even better understanding of de Bruijn's fault tolerance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Path Overlap</head><p>So far, we have been omitting a great deal of simulation results since most of the derived formulas in this paper were exact. In this section, we examine several empirical metrics and back our analysis of these metrics with simulations.</p><p>Define set P (x, y) to contain all vertices along some path from x to y. Denote by Q(x,y) the set of all vertices in P (x, y) except x and y: Q(x,y) = P (x,y)\{x ∪ y}. A graph's k-node-connectivity means that for every pair of nodes (x,y), there are exactly k pair-wise non-overlapping paths P 1 (x,y), . . . , P k (x,y): Qi(x,y) ∩ Qj(x,y) = ∅ for all i = j. Nodedisjoint paths are very attractive to peer-to-peer networks as they provide independent backup routing options when the main shortest path fails. Now notice that even though all three graphs under study have k node-disjoint paths for each pair (x,y), not all of these paths can be found using greedy routing at each node. In fact, in order to deterministically find all k non-overlapping paths between x and y in a generic graph, one needs to flood the entire graph using breadth-first search or similar techniques. Below we examine how well the routing rules in each graph are able to find non-overlapping paths and what happens to the diameter of the graph when nodes along the best path are failed.</p><p>For any pair of nodes (x,y), define Pi(x,y) to be the shortest (according to the greedy routing rules of the corresponding graph) path to y through x's neighbor i. We are interested in the structure of these shortest paths, because when the best neighbor towards y fails, the graph routes through the second-best neighbor also trying to achieve the shortest path to y. Hence, if these paths overlap and nodes common to multiple parallel paths fail, both the diameter and connectivity may significantly deteriorate.</p><p>Define T (x, y) to be the total number of vertices in all shortest paths Pi(x,y) from x to y and U (x,y) to be the number of unique vertices in all such paths: T (x, y) = Σ|Qi(x,y)| and U (x,y) = | ∪ Q i (x,y)|. Further define the average percentage U (G) of unique nodes in all parallel paths:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">U (G) = P x P y U (x, y) P x P y T (x, y) .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Finally, define path overlap J(G) to be 1 − U (G). We demonstrate the performance of the graphs using the same example of N = 1,024 for Chord and N = 1,000, k = 10 for de Bruijn since the two graphs are almost identical in their size and node degree. In these graphs, path overlap J(G) is 36% for Chord and only 3.7% for de Bruijn. In fact, for larger k, de Bruijn's overlap J(G) monotonically decays to zero inverse proportionally to the product of k and µ d (whereas in Chord, overlap J(G) actually increases for higher k and N ). This decrease in de Bruijn graphs is easy to explain -each set of k parallel paths between any pair of nodes (x,y) contains kµ d nodes on average, out of which only one vertex is repeated in more than one path. The difference in J(G) between Chord and de Bruijn is significant, but not quite unexpected given our previous discussion of expansion properties of each graph. This result means that de Bruijn (automatically) selects backup paths that do not overlap with the best shortest path or with each other.</p><p>Next examine <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref>, which shows the number of pairwise non-overlapping paths between any pair of nodes in the corresponding graph (we exclude pairs (x,x) and direct neighbors from the <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>. Interestingly, 50% of pairs (x,y) in Chord have only two non-overlapping shortest paths Q i (x, y) and Q j (x, y). Hence, when nodes along these paths fail, many alternative paths are likely to be affected. Further observe in the figure that the number of node-disjoint paths in Chord is given by a right-shifted geometric distribution with p = q = 1 /2 and (asymptotic) mean 1 + 1 p = 3. Thus, no matter how many neighbors k Chord has, its average number of node-disjoint paths Qi is no more than 3. Thus, for N = 32, the mean of the distribution is 2.61 and for N = 8,192 it is 2.99. As N tends to infinity, the expected number of node-disjoint paths tends to 3.</p><p>The right side of the same figure shows that de Bruijn graphs have at least 9 non-overlapping paths between any pair of nodes. This means that when nodes fail and packets get re-routed along the optimal paths of each neighbor, they have very little likelihood of encountering the already-failed nodes. Qualitatively, this difference leads to better faultresilience of de Bruijn graphs and smaller diameter under node failure.</p><p>In our next experiment, we introduced adversarial failures into the network. We failed all nodes along the shortest path from x to y and routed traffic through the second-best neighbor (i.e., the neighbor that is expected to have the shortest distance to y among the remaining neighbors). Then we failed all nodes along the second-best path and examined the third-best path, and so on. The distribution of average path lengths in the graph is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref>. As demonstrated by the figure, the average distance in Chord rises to as high as 17.6 hops when routed through some of the "suboptimal" neighbors. De Bruijn graphs, on the other hand, maintain the same low diameter and the average distance rises only by one hop. Note that we plotted the average distances according to path rank (from the best to the worst), which does not necessarily represent the order in which Chord or de Bruijn would typically choose the next-best neighbor. However, as the figure shows, all backup neighbors of de Bruijn graphs are approximately equivalent and achieve the same suboptimal average distance. This cannot be said about Chord, which has certain neighbors that show tendency to construct shortest paths that always overlap with the already-failed ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">ODRI</head><p>We have accumulated sufficient evidence that shows that de Bruijn graphs possess both short routing distances and high fault tolerance. In this section, we discuss ODRI, Optimal Diameter Routing Infrastructure, which builds de Bruijn graphs incrementally and preserves their nice properties at the application layer. Fortunately, de Bruijn graphs are very simple to build incrementally and many of the details (some of which we skip) are almost identical to those in Chord. We also feel that the algorithmic structure of ODRI is much simpler than that of other recently proposed fixed-degree graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Let N max be the maximum possible number of nodes in the system (such as 10 10 ). Organize the space of all possible nodes between [0, Nmax − 1] into a modulo-Nmax number field. Now notice that each node x in de Bruijn graphs is a base-k integer H x and that its neighboring rules can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">H x → (kH x + i) mod N max , i = 0, 1, ..., k − 1,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>since a shift left by one digit is equivalent to multiplication of Hx by k. In ODRI, each existing peer holds a consecutive stretch of the number space, which can be denoted by [z 1 , z 2 ], for some z 1 , z 2 ∈ [0, N max − 1]. To join the network, a node routes to the area of the circle where its hash index H x is located and asks the previous owner of the zone to split it in half. Notice that building the routing table for a newly joined node requires only O(1) message complexity as it can be copied from the previous owner of the zone. Notification of existing neighbors has another O(k) message overhead. Peer-to-peer linking rules are also straightforward. Consider node x that owns zone [z 1 , z 2 ]. Each of the integer values in [z 1 , z 2 ] corresponds to the underlying de Bruijn graph of size N max . Hence, to preserve de Bruijn linkage at the application layer, x must connect to all peers holding the other end of each edge originating in <ref type="bibr">[z1, z2]</ref>. This means that there is an application-layer edge (x, y) if and only if there is an edge (u, v) in the underlying de Bruijn graph such that u ∈ Z x and v ∈ Z y , where Z x and Z y are the corresponding zones held by x and y.</p><p>We next present several useful results about ODRI. We first address the issue of whether the application-layer graph maintains fixed degree and optimal diameter under the condition of equal-size zones. We then extend this analysis to random zones created by a uniform hashing function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Equal-Size Zones</head><p>Lemma 13. If all zones have the same fixed size, ODRI maintains the application-layer degree equal to k.</p><p>Given the assumptions of the previous lemma, notice that the application-layer graph in ODRI is a scaled-down version of the underlying de Bruijn graph. Thus, the diameter of the peer-to-peer graph under these conditions must remain optimal as we show in the next lemma.</p><p>Lemma 14. If all zones have the same fixed size, ODRI builds an N-node application-layer de Bruijn graph with diameter log k N .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Random Zones</head><p>Achieving constant-size zones using distributed join and leave processes is a non-trivial, but well-studied problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Equal zone sizes are desirable as they maintain a fixed out-degree at the application layer and provide better balancing of user objects between the peers. Assuming uniform random hashing, it can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> that after a sequence of N random joins, the maximum zone held by a peer is larger than average by a factor of O(ln N ) with high probability (note that the same bound applies to the maximum out-degree of each peer). The following result about the application-layer in-degree is less obvious.</p><p>Lemma 15. Under a uniform hashing function, ODRI's in-degree at each peer is no less than k with high probability.</p><p>Our next result shows that the imbalance in zone sizes has very little impact on the diameter of the peer-to-peer graph.</p><p>Lemma 16. Under a uniform hashing function, ODRI constructs a peer-level graph with diameter log k N (1 + o <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>) with high probability.</p><p>This lemma further implies that the average distance in the application-layer graph is also asymptotically optimal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Balancing Zones</head><p>To overcome imbalance in zone sizes in a highly dynamic environment, ODRI implements a variation of the "power of two choices" algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> during peer joins and departures. To join an existing ODRI network, a node x performs a biased walk through the graph starting in a random location and searching for the largest node to split. The walk is biased towards large nodes since they are more likely to "know" other large nodes. During departure, node x does the same biased walk looking for the smallest node to take over its zone Zx. The details of this framework are currently under investigation and will be presented in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSION</head><p>At this stage of peer-to-peer research with an overwhelming number of recent proposals, it is hard to assess the benefits of one peer-to-peer network over another without a unifying analytical framework that can capture graph-theoretic properties of each proposal. In this paper, we studied the diameter-degree tradeoff question of DHT research and conducted an extensive graph-theoretic comparison of several existing methods in terms of their routing performance and fault resilience. We then proposed a distributed architecture based on de Bruijn graphs and demonstrated that it offers an optimal diameter for a given fixed degree, optimal resilience (k-node connectivity), large bisection width, and good node expansion that guarantees very little overlap between parallel paths to any destination. Combining all these findings with incremental construction of ODRI, we conclude that de Bruijn graphs are viable and appealing structures for peer-to-peer networks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>…</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: A de Bruijn graph of degree 2 and diameter 3 (left).
