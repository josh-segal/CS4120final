				<p>In this paper, we study the prize-collecting version of constrained forest problems with an arbitrary 0-1 connectivity requirement function and a submodular penalty function. Our framework generalizes the Prize Collecting Generalized Steiner Tree framework of Ha-jiaghayi and Jain [HJ06] to incorporate more general connectivity requirements and penalty functions. We generalize their primal-dual algorithm using submod-ular function minimization to give a 3-approximation algorithm, and devise an LP rounding algorithm with a performance guarantee of 2.54.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Our model</head><p>In this section, we further discuss our prize-collecting forest problem (PCF). We begin by discussing the connection of PCF to the 0-1 proper functions of <ref type="bibr">[GW95]</ref>. Next, we show that the result of Hajiaghayi and Jain <ref type="bibr">[HJ06]</ref> is a special case of our model. Finally, we show that PCF does not reduce to the PCGST of Hajiaghayi and Jain. We also note that the model of Hayrapetyan et al. <ref type="bibr">[HST05]</ref> is a special case of our model, but defer details to the full version of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Connection to proper functions</head><p>Proper connectivity requirement functions were first defined in <ref type="bibr">[GW95]</ref>. A function f : 2 V → {0, 1} is proper if f (V ) = 0, f (V − S) = f (S) for all S ⊆ V , and for disjoint sets A and B, f (A ∪ B) ≤ max(f (A), f (B)).</p><p>We now argue that proper functions are closely related to the penalty function we have introduced. Given an arbitrary 0-1 connectivity function f : 2 V → {0, 1}, we can ensure that our algorithm returns a feasible solution for the function by setting π(S) = ∞ whenever there is S ∈ S such that f (S) = 1 and π(S) = 0 otherwise. This penalty function obeys the emptyset, monotonicity, submodularity, and inactivity properties. However, in order to obey the complement property, we cannot have f (S) 񮽙 = f (V − S), and in order to obey the union property we cannot have f (A) = f (B) = 0 and f (A ∪ B) = 1 for disjoint A and B. Thus for our model of penalty function, if we enforce that a feasible solution is returned for the connectivity function f , that function must be proper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">PCGST problem of Hajiaghayi and Jain</head><p>[HJ06] Hajiaghayi and Jain <ref type="bibr">[HJ06]</ref> consider the the prize-collecting generalized Steiner tree problem in which there are a set of pairs of vertices (s 1 , t 1 ), . . . , (s k , t k ) to connect along with penalties π i for not connecting the pair (s i , t i ). The goal is to find a set of edges F that minimizes the cost of the edges in F plus the penalties of the pairs of vertices not connected by F . We can map this problem into our framework as follows. The connectivity requirement function f for our model is the function f (S) = 1 iff there exists some i such that |S ∩ {s i , t i }| = 1, and the penalty π for a family S for our model is the sum of penalties of pairs which are separated by some set in S; that is π(S) = i:∃S∈S:|S∩{si,ti}|=1 π i . The resulting penalty, as it turns out, satisfies all properties that we require from the penalty function: it is easy to see that the emptyset, inactivity, and monotonicity properties are satisfied. Hajiaghayi and Jain show that the submodularity property is satisfied (Lemma 2.3 of <ref type="bibr">[HJ06]</ref>). The complement property is not hard to see: V − S separates no more pairs than S. Similarly, for any two S 1 , S 2 , their union S 1 ∪ S 2 separates no more pairs than do S 1 and S 2 , so the union property is satisfied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Some other problems that can be cast into our model Consider the PCGST problem of</head><p>Hajiaghayi and Jain with a variation on the penalty of a solution. There are k pairs of vertices with penalties π 1 = · · · = π k = 1. The penalty of the solution is the minimum of the number of unconnected pairs and a fixed number l ≤ k. It means that the penalty increases linearly with the number of unconnected pairs, but is upper bounded by l. This problem does not fit Hajiaghayi-Jain's model. We next show that the problem can be cast into our framework.</p><p>The connectivity requirement function f is same as the one described in Section 2.2. The penalty function is also the one described in the section except that it is upper bounded by l. It is easy to see that the penalty function satisfies emptyset and monotonicity properties. The union, complement, and inactivity properties also follow the same argument as in Section 2.2. For submodularity of the penalty function, we will prove the equivalent statement that for families S and T ⊇ S and for any subset S ∈ T , π(S ∪ {S}) − π(S) ≥ π(T ∪ {S}) − π(T ). If S separates more than l pairs, then the inequality is trivially true. Let S separate a ≤ l pairs which are to be connected and S separates an additional b pairs (not already separated by S). Clearly T separates a + ≥ a pairs and T ∪{S} separates at most a + + b pairs. So the left hand side of the inequality is min(a + b, l) − a, and the right hand side is at most</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">min(a + + b, l) − min(a + , l). One can easily check that min(a + b, l) − a ≥ min(a + + b, l) − min(a + , l)</formula><p>. This proves the submodularity of the function π(·).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The primal dual algorithm</head><p>In this section, we give a primal-dual approximation algorithm to solve our problem. The LP relaxation of the integer program (PCF-IP) is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">min e c e x e + S π(S)z S (PCF-LP) s.t. e∈δ(S) x e + S:S∈S z S ≥ f (S) for all S ⊆ V, x e , z S ≥ 0 for all e, S.</formula><p>The dual of the LP relaxation (PCF-LP) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">max S⊆V f (S) · y S (PCF-D) s.t. S:e∈δ(S) y S ≤ c e ∀e ∈ E (type-(e)) S:S∈S y S ≤ π(S) ∀S ⊆ 2 V (type-(f)) y S ≥ 0 ∀S ⊆ V.</formula><p>Our algorithm is similar to Algorithm A in <ref type="bibr">[HJ06]</ref>, though it differs in how it finds the tight family of subsets and how it performs the reverse delete step. We next give the idea behind our algorithm. For its precise description, see Algorithm 1.</p><p>We introduce some terminology first. We call an edge e tight if its corresponding inequality (of type-(e)) in (PCF-D) holds with equality, i.e., S:e∈δ(S) y S = c e . Similarly, we call a family S ⊆ 2 V tight if its corresponding inequality (of type-(f)) holds with equality, i.e., S∈S y S = π(S). For a family S ⊆ 2 V , we call T the closure of S (denoted closure(S)) if T ⊇ S and T is closed under taking unions and complements (and hence intersections and set differences too).</p><p>We keep track of three types of components, (i) active components (C a )-components that need an edge out of them (f (S) = 1) but do not have one yet, (ii) inactive components (D i )-components having f (S) = 0, and (iii) marked components (D m )-components that needed an edge out of them originally but our algorithm has decided not to have such an edge and pay the penalty; these are denoted by f (S) = 1 → 0.</p><p>To start off, there are n components corresponding to n singleton vertices. We set them active or inactive depending on whether their connectivity requirement is 1 or 0 respectively. This is the initialization phase.</p><p>In the dual-increase phase, we uniformly increase the duals of all active subsets in C a . In this process, either another edge becomes tight or another family of subsets becomes tight. (See Section 5 for details on how to check tightness of edges and families.) If an edge e connecting two components C u and C v becomes tight, we add e to the set of candidate edges for the output solution, remove C u and C v from the family C a of active sets (if they are there), make a new component C u ∪ C v , and set it active (and add it to C a ) if f (C u ∪C v ) = 1, and inactive otherwise (and add it to D i ). If, on the other hand, a family S of subsets {S 1 , S 2 , . . . , S |S| } becomes tight, we mark all these subsets, remove them from the family C a of active sets (if they are there), and add them to the family D m of marked sets.</p><p>When there is no active component remaining whose dual can be increased, we enter the reverse delete phase of our algorithm. We consider edges added to the solution in the reverse order. Consider the two components C 1 and C 2 resulting from deletion of edge e in the current solution. If e is the only edge out of C i (i = 1 or 2) and C i is not in the closure of inactive sets and marked sets then we retain the edge e; otherwise, we delete it from the solution. The idea is that if e is redundant or only necessary for sets whose penalty has been paid for (because they are either inactive or marked), it should be deleted from the solution to decrease the cost of edges in the solution.</p><p>Let F ′ be the set of edges remaining after the reverse delete procedure and let C(V, F ′ ) be the connected components of F ′ . Then our algorithm returns F ′ as its set of edges and closure(C(V, F ′ )) as the family of subsets on which it will pay the penalty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Implementation of the algorithm</head><p>We now argue that our algorithm can be implemented in polynomial time. The central difficulty is that of finding which of the 2 2 n type-(f) dual constraints corresponding to family of subsets will next become tight given our dual increase scheme.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Polynomial time complexity</head><p>Algorithm 1 makes at most 2n iterations of the while statement. This is because in each iteration of the while loop, we decrease the sum of the number of active components and the number of components. If an edge becomes tight, then we decrease the total number of components (and may also decrease the number of active components), and if a family of subsets becomes tight, we again decrease the number of active components. To start with, we have n components, all of which can be active, which gives rise to a bound of 2n.</p><p>At any point, the collection of sets that have positive dual form a laminar family (that is, for any pair of sets with positive dual, either the two are disjoint or one contains the other). This implies that at the end of the algorithm there are at most 2n sets with positive dual. Each step through the while statement takes polynomial time. Checking the tightness of an edge e requires us to look at all the components with positive dual and adding the duals which have the edge e in their boundary. We will show in Section 5.3 how to check the tightness of a family of subsets via binary search and submodular function minimization, which will be implementable in polynomial time.</p><p>The reverse delete step is at most n iterations and each iteration requires us to check whether two end point components of an edge are in the closure of certain sets.

Thus the whole reverse delete step also runs in polynomial time.</p></div>

We will prove a property of the family of subsets which ought to go tight next in order to significantly narrow down our search for tight families from 2 2 n candidates to 2 2n candidates. We show that a family containing a nonactive set whose dual value is zero does not need to be considered for determining a tight family of subsets.</p><p>Lemma 5.1. Let S be a family of subsets of V containing a non-active subset S ∈ S with y S = 0. If S goes tight next while we increase the dual variables of active sets, then there exists a subfamily S ′ of S that will go tight no later than S goes tight.</p><p>Proof. Let S = {S 1 , S 2 , . . . , S k } be the family to go tight next the earliest, S k be a non-active subset such that y S k = 0, and the first j subsets of S (without loss of generality) be active sets where 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1. We show that the family S ′ = S − {S k } goes tight no later than S. Indeed, the increase in the dual variables needed for S ′ to go tight is ε S ′ = 1 j π(S ′ ) − k−1 i=1 y Si and the increase in the dual variables needed for S to go tight is</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ε S = 1 j π(S) − k i=1 y Si .</formula><p>Using monotonicity of the function π and the fact that y S k = 0, we conclude that ε S ′ ≤ ε S proving that the family S ′ goes tight no later than the family S.

We now proceed to present a procedure to find which family of subsets goes tight next.</p><p>5.3 The method to find a tight family We want to find the maximum value of ε such that if we increase all active duals by ε, all constraints of type-(f) in the dual program are still satisfied. We can replace "all constraints of type-(f)" to "all constraints of type-(f) corresponding to subfamilies of C a ∪ D + " in the above statement, since the first constraint to be violated as we increase dual variables will correspond to a subfamily of C a ∪ D + as proved in Lemma 5.1.

We use binary search to find the correct value of ε 0 . We keep a lower bound ε low on the value of ε 0 (take ε low = 0 to start with), and an upper bound ε high on the value of ε 0 (take ε high = π(S)− P S∈S yS |active(S)| for a particular family to start with, say π({S})−yS 1 for some S ∈ C a ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Since ε 0 ∈ [ε low , ε high ], ε 0 ∈ [ε low , ε middle ] or ε 0 ∈ [ε middle , ε high ]</formula><p>where ε middle = (ε low + ε high )/2. To determine which interval ε 0 lies in, we use submodular function minimization. If ε 0 ≥ ε middle , then the minimum of the function π ′ (S) def = π(S) − S∈S y S − ε middle |active(S)| over all S ⊆ C a ∪ D + is nonnegative. If ε 0 &lt; ε middle , then the minimum of the function π ′ (S) over all subfamilies of C a ∪ D + is strictly negative (because some constraint is violated). Also note that both the conditions above are if and only if conditions. Therefore testing whether ε 0 ≥ ε middle reduces to checking whether the minimum of the function π ′ (S) over subfamilies of C a ∪D + is nonnegative. The function π ′ (S) is a submodular function for a fixed value of ε middle since its first term is submodular and the last two terms are modular. We apply a polynomial-time submodular function minimization algorithm <ref type="bibr">[IFF01, Sch00]</ref> to minimize the function and hence determine which of the two interval ε 0 lies in. Note that we can do this in oracle polynomial-time and time polynomial in n, since the ground set of π ′ are the sets in C a ∪ D + , and we have previously argued that there are at most 2n such sets. This further implies that we need at most O(n 2 ) space to query the oracle for π(·).</p><p>Once our interval [ε low , ε high ] becomes "sufficiently" small, we stop the binary search and find the right value of ε 0 in that interval. This is the intuitive idea, which it turns out takes a bit of care to turn into a formal proof. We need the following lemma to start.</p><p>Lemma 5.2. The value of each non-zero dual variable y S and each amount ǫ of dual increase in each iteration of the algorithm can be expressed by rational numbers whose numerators are integers of value at most (max S π(S) + max e∈E c e ) · (6n 2 )! and whose denominators are integers of value at most (6n 2 )!. Thus these variables can be expressed with bit complexity at most O(log(max S π(S)) + log max e∈E c e + n 2 log n).</p><p>If we do binary search until the window size |ε high − ε low | is smaller than (1/(6n 2 )!) 2 , there can be at most one rational number in the window with denominator at most (6n 2 )!. We now want to determine the exact value of ε in this interval. We use a procedure Best Approximation from Grötschel, Lovász, and Schrijver [GLS88, Theorem 5.1.9], which determines a rational number β of denominator at most N that minimizes |α − β| for input α. It does so in time polynomial in the encoding size of N and α. We run one more submodular minimization to halve the window size of the binary search, then apply this procedure with N = (6n 2 )! and α set to whichever of ε high or ε low was last modified. This guarantees that Best Approximation will find ε 0 .</p><p>Therefore, finding the right value of ε 0 can be done in time polynomial in log(max S π(S)) + log(max e c e ) + n 2 log n. The number of iterations of binary search required to bring the interval length down to 1/((6n 2 )!) 2 is at most O(log(max S π(S)) + n 2 log n). Furthermore, each iteration of binary search requires polynomial time, so the overall time of finding a tight family can be bounded by a polynomial in log(max S π(S)) + log(max e c e ) + n 2 log n.</p><p>Once we find the right value of ε 0 , we solve the problem of minimizing π(S) − S∈S y S − ε 0 |active(S)| over subfamilies of C a ∪ D + . As argued above, the minimum value will be zero and the corresponding minimizer family will be the candidate family to go tight next. Thus, the family to go tight next can be found in polynomial time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">An LP-rounding approach</head><p>In this section, we present an LP-rounding algorithm with a better performance guarantee when the connectivity requirement function f is proper. Notice that formulation (PCF-LP) has an exponential number of constraints and a doubly exponential (2 2 n where n = |V |) number of variables, so even solving the LP is a challenging task. In fact, it is not even clear that a basic solution of (PCF-LP) admits a polynomial-size description -a basic solution of the LP may yet set 2 n of the z S variables to be positive! Our result is built on three components. First, we show that by suitably transforming (PCF-LP), one can obtain a compact, convex programming relaxation of the problem that is equivalent to (PCF-LP) and has only x e variables. Next, we give a simple procedure to round any fractional solution to this convex program to an integer solution losing a factor of at most 2.54. Since the convex program is equivalent to the LP (PCF-LP), the rounding procedure may also be viewed as a rounding procedure for (PCF-LP) with the property that one only needs the x-component of the fractional solution in order to implement it. Finally, we show that the convex program can be solved efficiently using the ellipsoid method. The key ingredient that we need to run the ellipsoid method is a procedure that computes a subgradient of the objective function at any point x. Although the convex program yields a compact relaxation of the prize-collecting problem, this poses several challenges since computing the subgradient at a given point requires solving an exponential-size linear program. Nevertheless, we will prove certain structural properties and show that a subgradient can indeed be computed in polynomial time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">A compact convex programming relaxation</head><p>The idea behind the compact formulation is simple. Suppose we fix the values of the x e variables. Then, one can consider an optimal setting of the z S variables corresponding to these x e values and denote the penalty incurred for these z S values (which is a function of only the x e variables) by g(x). So we can restate the objective function as e c e x e + g(x), and our problem is to minimize e c e x e + g(x) subject to the constraints that 0 ≤ x e ≤ 1 for every edge e. More formally, we obtain the following program: x e ∀S ⊆ V, z S ≥ 0 ∀S.</p><p>Here (Pen-P) is the LP that determines the penalty incurred at a fractional solution x. It is easy to see that (PC-CP) is equivalent to (PCF-LP), and it is straightforward to show that the objective function of (PC-CP) is convex. Let OPT LP denote the optimal value of (PC-CP) (and (PCF-LP)).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>We can model this by the following integer program: min e∈E c e x e + S⊆2 V π(S)z S (PCF-IP) s.t. e:e∈δ(S)</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Solving the convex program</head><p>The convex program (PC-CP) can be solved efficiently using the ellipsoid method provided that one can find a subgradient of the objective function at any given point.</p><p>for any feasible x ′ . It turns out that a subgradient can be computed if we can solve the following dual of (Pen-P).</p><p>But this dual has 2 n variables and 2 2 n constraints! One helpful and important fact is that since π is submodular and the feasible region of (Pen-D) is the polymatroid associated with π, we can use the Edmonds' greedy algorithm <ref type="bibr">[Edm70]</ref> to obtain an optimal solution to both (Pen-D) and (Pen-P). This still does not solve the problem fully since the ground set of the polymatroid is still of size 2 n , and the naive greedy algorithm iterates through all ground elements. The main idea, now, is to show that there exists an optimal solution to (Pen-P) with at most n non-zero z values and an optimal solution to (Pen-D) with at most n non-zero y values, and in fact, one where the sets S with y S &gt; 0 form a sparse laminar collection. Using the solution y, we can compute a subgradient of h in (PC-CP) in polynomial time, and thereby implement the ellipsoid method. Note that we do not require f to be proper in order to solve (PC-CP); this is only needed for the rounding argument. The algorithm to compute an optimal dual solution is as follows. For a set S and collection A, let confl(S, A) denote the number of "conflicts" between S and A, that is, |{S ′ ∈ A : S ∩ S ′ 񮽙 = ∅, S \ S ′ 񮽙 = ∅, S ′ \ S 񮽙 = ∅}|. We initialize y S ← 0 for all sets S, and L ← ∅. While</p><p>We very briefly argue the correctness of the algorithm; the details are deferred to the full version of the paper. One way to prove this is to show that the above algorithm is in a sense equivalent to a run of Edmonds' greedy algorithm. The above algorithm considers sets in increasing order of x(δ(S)) value, instead of decreasing f (S) − x(δ(S)) value as required by the greedy algorithm. But one can show that ordering sets in this way, and setting their values as in the greedy algorithm (so as to satisfy (6.4)), also works. Intuitively, this is because a set S with f (S) = 0 adds 0 value to the penalty of any collection, so these sets can be "swapped around" without affecting optimality. Next, one can show (Lemma 6.4) that although the algorithm only considers sets that preserve the laminarity of L, there is an underlying valid ordering of the sets (by increasing x(δ(.)) value) that yields the same solution y. Combining these two properties shows that the solution constructed y is optimal to (Pen-D).</p><p>Let L = {S 1 , . . . , S ℓ }, ℓ ≤ n, where x(δ(S 1 )) ≤ . . . ≤ x(δ(S ℓ )). Using this laminar family, one can construct a sparse optimal solution to (Pen-P) that satisfies the properties stated in Section 6.2. Let L &gt;0 = {S ∈ L : y S &gt; 0} = {T 1 , . . . , T k }, where T j = S i(j) and i(0) := 0 &lt; i(1) ≤ . . . ≤ i(k) &lt; i(k + 1) := ℓ + 1. Let S i = {S 1 , . . . , S i } for i = 0, . . . , ℓ (with S 0 := ∅). Define S 0 = ∅ = T 0 , and let T j = z-clos(S i(j) ), w j := x(δ(T j )) for j = 0, . . . , k, and w k+1 := 1. Theorem 6.2. (i) y is an optimal solution to <ref type="bibr">(Pen-D)</ref>.</p><p>(ii) The solution z = (z S ) S⊆2 V given by z Tj = (w j+1 − w j ) for j = 0, . . . , k, and z S = 0 for any other S ⊆ 2 V is an optimal solution to (Pen-P).</p></div>
