				<p>We investigate the problem of allocating energy from renewable sources to flexible consumers in electricity markets. We assume there is a renewable energy supplier that provides energy according to a time-varying (and possibly unpredictable) supply process. The plant must serve consumers within a specified delay window, and incurs a cost of drawing energy from other (possibly non-renewable) sources if its own supply is not sufficient to meet the deadlines. We formulate two stochastic optimization problems: The first seeks to minimize the time average cost of using the other sources (and hence strives for the most efficient utilization of the renewable source). The second allows the renewable source to dynamically set a price for its service, and seeks to maximize the resulting time average profit. These problems are solved via the Lyapunov optimization technique. Our resulting algorithms do not require knowledge of the statistics of the time-varying supply and demand processes and are robust to arbitrary sample path variations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The highly variable and unpredictable nature of some renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar) has been a major obstacle to their integration. For example, a recent study conducted by Enernex for wind power integration in Minnesota <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> indicates that the variability and day-ahead forecast errors will result in an additional $2.11 − $4.41 (for 15% and 25% penetration) per MWh of delivered wind power. Along the same lines, the CAISO report <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> predicted that ten minute real-time energy prices could increase substantially due to wind forecasting errors and identified day-ahead and sameday forecasts and modeling as important tasks for integration of renewable resources.</p><p>The necessity to offset variability by stand-by generators and system backup investments substantially increases the cost of renewables. One approach that can mitigate this problem is to couple this supply variability to demand side flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. The renewable power suppliers could sell their energy at a lower price to consumers that are willing to wait in a queue, given that it will be served to them within a pre-agreed deadline. This essentially allows a lower price of renewable energy to consumers willing to provide this extra time flexibility. The renewable power supplier can now use this flexibility to deliver the energy when it is available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The supplier will sometimes, hopefully rarely, be in a situation when a prior deadline commitment cannot be matched and will have to purchase the extra energy from the energy spot market (or The authors are with the Electrical Engineering department at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.</p><p>This material is supported in part by one or more of the following: the DARPA IT-MANET program grant W911NF-07-0028, the NSF Career grant CCF-0747525. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Note that in this paper we assume no energy storage although it can be naturally incorporated into our framework. maintain a costly system backup). Papavasiliou and Oren <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> introduced this problem and proposed an exact backward dynamic programming algorithm and an efficient approximate dynamic programming algorithm for the scheduling decisions of the renewable energy supplier.</p><p>In this paper we build a similar model and utilize the technique of Lyapunov optimization initially developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>[12] <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> for dynamic control of queueing systems for wireless networks. We show that the queuing model naturally fits in the renewable supplier scheduling problem and present a simple energy allocation algorithm that does not require prior statistical information and is provably close to optimal. The proposed framework can be extended to include pricing, multiple queues (with different deadlines) and different objective functions, building on the general results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. We finally evaluate the proposed algorithm on actual CAISO spot market and wind energy production data and show substantial reduction to the operating costs for the renewable supplier compared to a simple greedy algorithm.</p><p>In particular, we consider a single renewable energy plant that operates in discrete time with unit timeslots t ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . .}, and provides s(t) units of energy on each slot t. The s(t) process corresponds to the renewable supply and is assumed to be time varying and unpredictable. Since we assume no storage, the energy s(t) must either be used or wasted. Demands for this energy arrive randomly according to a process a(t) (being the amount of energy that is requested on slot t). We assume that consumers requesting energy are flexible, and can tolerate their energy requests being satisfied with some delay. The requests are thus stored in a queue. Every slot t, we use all of our supply s(t) to serve the requests in the queue in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. However, this may not be enough to meet all of the requests within a timely manner, and hence we also decide to purchase an amount of energy x(t) from an outside (possibly non-renewable) plant. Letting Q(t) represent the total energy requests in our queue on slot t, we have the following update equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q(t + 1) = max[Q(t) − s(t) − x(t), 0] + a(t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The value x(t) is a control decision variable, and incurs a cost x(t)γ(t) on slot t, where γ(t) is a process that specifies the per-unit-cost of using the outside energy supply on slot t. The value of γ(t) can represent a current market price for guaranteed energy services from (possibly non-renewable) sources. As such, the decision to use x(t) units of energy on slot t means the outside source agrees to provide this much energy at time t+K for some fixed (and small) integer K ≥ 0, for the price x(t)γ(t). Without loss of generality, we assume throughout that K = 0, so that the energy request is removed from our queue on the same slot in which we decide to use the outside source. In the actual implementation, requests that are served from the outside source can be removed from the primary queue Q(t) but must still wait an additional K slots.</p><p>We first look at the problem of choosing x(t) to stabilize our queue Q(t) while minimizing the time average of the cost x(t)γ(t) and also providing a guarantee on the maximum delay D max spent in the queue. If the future values of supply, demand, and market price values (s(t), a(t), γ(t)) were known in advance, one could in principle make x(t) decisions that minimize total time average cost, possibly choosing x(t) = 0 for all t if it is possible to meet all demands using only the renewable energy s(t). The challenge is to provide an efficient algorithm without knowing the future. To this end, we first assume the vector process (s(t), a(t), γ(t)) is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) over slots but has an unknown probability distribution. Under this assumption, we develop an algorithm, parameterized by a positive value V , that comes within O(1/V ) of the minimum time average cost required to stabilize the queue, with a worst-case delay guarantee that is O(V ). The parameter V can be tuned as desired to provide average cost arbitrarily close to optimal, with a tradeoff in delay. We further show that the same algorithm is provably robust to non-i.i.d. situations, and operates efficiently even for arbitrary sample paths for (s(t), a(t), γ(t)). Finally, we extend the problem to consider pricing decisions at the renewable energy source, so that the requests a(t) are now influenced by the current prices. In this case, we design a related algorithm that maximizes time average profit.</p><p>The Lyapunov optimization technique we use <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>[12] <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> is related to the primal-dual and fluid-model techniques in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>[16] <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>[12] <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> establishes a general [O(1/V ), O(V )] performance-congestion tradeoff for stochastic network optimization problems with i.i.d. (and more general ergodic) processes. Recent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>[19] <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> provides similar results on a sample path basis, without any probabilistic assumptions. We apply these results in our current paper. Further, we extend the theory by introducing a novel virtual queue that turns an average delay constraint of O(V ) (which is achievable with the prior analytical techniques) into a worst case delay guarantee that is also O(V ).</p><p>It is useful to distinguish the proposed Lyapunov optimization method that we use in this paper from dynamic programming techniques. Dynamic programming can be used to solve stronger versions of our problem (such as minimizing average cost subject to a delay constraint) see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. However, dynamic programming requires more stringent system modeling assumptions, has a more complex solution that typically requires knowledge of the supply, demand, and market price probabilities, and cannot necessarily adapt if these probabilities change and/or if there are unmodeled correlations in the actual processes. It involves computation of a value function that can be difficult when the state space of the system is large, and suffers from a curse of dimensionality when applied to large dimensional systems (such as systems with many queues).</p><p>In contrast, Lyapunov optimization is relatively simple to implement, does not need a-priori statistical knowledge, and is robust to non-i.i.d. and non-ergodic behavior. Further, it has no curse of dimensionality and hence can be applied just as easily in extended formulations that have multiple queues corresponding to multiple customers requesting different deadlines, contrary to dynamic programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> which would require exponential complexity in the number of users.</p><p>The reason for this efficiency is that Lyapunov optimization relaxes the question that dynamic programming asks: Rather than minimizing time average cost subject to a delay constraint, it seeks to push time average cost towards the more ambitious minimum over all possible algorithms that can stabilize the queue (without regard to the delay constraint). It then specifies an explicit bound on the resulting queue congestion, which depends on the desired proximity to the minimum cost (as defined by the [O(1/V ), O(V )] performance-congestion tradeoff). However, the resulting time average queue congestion (and delay) that is achieved is not necessarily the optimal that could be achieved over all possible algorithms that yield the same time average performance cost.</p><p>In the next section, we formulate the basic model under the assumption that the (s(t), a(t), γ(t)) vector is i.i.d. over slots, and present the main allocation algorithm. Section III extends to the case when the renewable power source can set a price for its services. These algorithms are provably robust to non-i.i.d. situations and arbitrary sample paths of events, as shown in Section IV-A. Section IV-B presents an experimental evaluation of our algorithm on a real six-month data set and shows substantial gains over a simple greedy scheduling algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE DYNAMIC ALLOCATION ALGORITHM</head><p>Suppose that the supply process s(t), the request process a(t), and the market price process γ(t), as described in the introduction, form a vector (s(t), a(t), γ(t)) that is i.i.d. over slots with some unknown probability distribution. We further assume the values of s(t), a(t), γ(t) are deterministically bounded by finite constants s max , a max , γ max , so that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">0 ≤ s(t) ≤ s max , 0 ≤ a(t) ≤ a max , 0 ≤ γ(t) ≤ γ max ∀t (2)</formula><p>The queue backlog Q(t) evolves according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The decision variable x(t) is chosen every slot t in reaction to the current (s(t), a(t), γ(t)) (and possibly additional queue state information) subject to the constraint 0 ≤ x(t) ≤ x max for all t, where x max is a finite upper bound. We assume that x max ≥ a max so that it is always possible to stabilize the queue Q(t) (and this can be done with one slot delay if we choose x(t) = x max for all t). Define c as the time average cost incurred by our control policy (assuming temporarily that our policy yields such a well defined limit):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">c = lim t→∞</formula><p>where Q is the time average expected queue backlog, defined:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Q = lim sup t→∞ 1 t t−1 τ =0 E {Q(τ )</formula><p>} Define c * as the infimum time average cost associated with the above problem, considering all possible ways of choosing x(t) over time. The value of c * is an ambitious target because the above problem is defined only in terms of a queue stability constraint and does not impose any additional delay constraint. We shall construct a solution, parameterized by a constant V &gt; 0, that satisfies the constraints of the above problem and pushes the average cost within O(1/V ) of the optimal value c * . Further, we show that our algorithm has the additional property that worst case delay is no more than O(V ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Delay-Aware Virtual Queue</head><p>We solve the above problem while also maintaining finite worst case delay using the following novel "virtual queue" Z(t): Fix a parameter &gt; 0, to be specified later. Define Z(0) = 0, and define the virtual queue Z(t) for t ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . .} according to the following update:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Z(t + 1) = max[Z(t) − s(t) − x(t) + 1 {Q(t)&gt;0} , 0]<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where 1 {Q(t)&gt;0} is an indicator function that is 1 if Q(t) &gt; 0, and zero else. The intuition is that Z(t) has the same service process as Q(t) (being s(t) + x(t)), but now has an arrival process that adds whenever the actual queue backlog is nonempty. This ensures that Z(t) grows if there are requests in the Q(t) queue that have not been serviced for a long time. If we can control the system to ensure that the queues Q(t) and Z(t) have finite upper bounds, then we can ensure all requests are served with a worst case delay given in the following lemma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> Lemma 1: (Worst Case Delay) Suppose the system is controlled so that Z(t) ≤ Z max and Q(t) ≤ Q max for all t, for some positive constants Z max and Q max . Then all requests are fulfilled with a maximum delay of D max slots, where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D max = (Q max + Z max )//<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Proof: Consider any slot t for which a(t) &gt; 0. We show that the requests a(t) are fulfilled on or before time t + D max . Suppose not (we shall reach a contradiction). Then during slots τ ∈ {t + 1, . . . , t + D max } it must be that Q(τ ) &gt; 0 (else the requests a(t) would have been served before slot τ ). Thus, 1 {Q(τ )&gt;0} = 1, and from (6) we have that for all τ ∈ {t + 1, . . . , t + D max }:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Z(τ + 1) ≥ Z(τ ) − s(τ ) − x(τ ) +</formula><p>Summing the above over τ ∈ {t + 1, . . . , t + D max } yields:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Z(t+D max +1)−Z(t+1) ≥ − t+Dmax τ =t+1 [s(τ )+x(τ )]+D max</formula><p>Rearranging and using the fact that Z(t + 1) ≥ 0 and Z(t + D max + 1) ≤ Z max yields:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">t+Dmax τ =t+1 [s(τ ) + x(τ )] ≥ D max − Z max<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Now note that the requests a(t) are first available for service at time t + 1, and are part of the backlog Q(t + 1) (see <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>). Because Q(t + 1) ≤ Q max and because service is FIFO, these requests a(t) are served on or before time t + D max whenever there are at least Q max units of energy served during the interval τ ∈ {t + 1, . . . , t + D max }. Because we have assumed the requests a(t) are not served by time t + D max , it must be that t+Dmax τ =t+1 [s(τ ) + x(τ )] &lt; Q max . Using this in (8) yields:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Q max &gt; D max − Z max</formula><p>This implies that D max &lt; (Q max + Z max )//, contradicting the definition of D max in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(7)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Lyapunov Optimization</head><p>Define Θ(t) = (Z(t), Q(t)) as the concatenated vector of the real and virtual queues. As a scalar measure of the congestion in both the Z(t) and Q(t) queues, we define the following Lyapunov function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L(Θ(t)) = 1 2 [Z(t) 2 + Q(t) 2 ]</formula><p>. Define the conditional 1-slot Lyapunov drift as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∆(Θ(t)) = E {L(Θ(t + 1)) − L(Θ(t))|Θ(t)}<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Following the drift-plus-penalty framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>[12] <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, our control algorithm is designed to observe the current queue states Z(t), Q(t) and the current (s(t), a(t), γ(t)) vector, and to make a decision x(t) (where 0 ≤ x(t) ≤ x max ) to minimize a bound on the following expression every slot t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">∆(Θ(t)) + V E {γ(t)x(t)|Θ(t)}</formula><p>where V is a positive parameter that will be useful to affect a performance-delay tradeoff. The intuition is that taking actions to minimize ∆(Θ(t)) alone would push both queues towards lower backlog but incur a large penatly, and so our approach minimizes a weighted sum of drift and penalty. Lemma 2: (Drift Bound) For any control policy that satisfies 0 ≤ x(t) ≤ x max for all t, the drift-plus-penalty expression for all slots t satisfies:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∆(Θ(t)) + V E {γ(t)x(t)|Θ(t)} ≤ B + V E {γ(t)x(t)|Θ(t)} +Q(t)E {a(t) − s(t) − x(t)|Θ(t)} +Z(t)E { − s(t) − x(t)|Θ(t)} (10)</formula><p>where the constant B is defined:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">B = (s max + x max ) 2 + a 2 max 2 + max[ 2 , (s max + x max ) 2 ] 2<label>(11</label></formula><p>) Proof: See our technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>

Indeed, define˜x define˜ define˜x(t) as the actual amount purchased from the plant, given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">˜ x(t) = x(t) if Q(t) − s(t) ≥ x(t) min[Q(t) − s(t), 0] otherwise (13) Then we have˜xhave˜ have˜x(t) ≤ x(t) for all t.</formula><p>Theorem 1: (Performance Analysis) Suppose x max ≥ max <ref type="bibr">[a max , ]</ref>.

Using = 0 preserves parts (a) and (c) but does not give a finite D max . More discussion of the = 0 case is given in Section IV-B.</p><p>Proof: (Theorem 1 part (a)) We first show that Q(t) ≤ V γ max +a max for all t. This is clearly true for t = 0 (because Q(0) = 0). Suppose it holds for slot t. We show it also holds for slot t + 1. Consider the case when Q(t) ≤ V γ max . Then Q(t+1) ≤ V γ max +a max , because the queue can increase by at most a max on any slot (see dynamics <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>). Thus, the result holds in this case. Now consider the opposite case when V γ max &lt; Q(t) ≤ V γ max + a max . In this case, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Q(t) + Z(t) ≥ Q(t) &gt; V γ max ≥ V γ(t)</formula><p>and hence the algorithm will choose x(t) = x max according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(12)</ref>. If Q(t) − x max − s(t) &gt; 0, then on slot t we serve at least x max units of data. Because arrivals a(t) are at most a max (and a max ≤ x max ), the queue cannot increase on the next slot and so Q(t + 1) ≤ Q(t) ≤ V γ max + a max . Finally, if Q(t) − x max − s(t) ≤ 0, then by (1) we have Q(t + 1) = a(t) ≤ a max , again being less than or equal to V γ max +a max .</p><p>Therefore, Q(t) ≤ V γ max + a max for all t. The proof that Z(t) ≤ V γ max + for all t is similar and omitted for brevity.</p><p>Proof: (Theorem 1 part (b)) This follows immediately from Lemma 1 together with part (a).</p><p>The proof of Theorem 1 part (c) uses the Lyapunov optimization technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, and is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PRICING FOR MAXIMUM PROFIT</head><p>We now extend the problem to consider pricing decisions. Instead of a process a(t) that represents requests arriving at slot t, we define a process y(t), called the demand state on slot t. The demand state captures any properties of the demand that may affect requests for the renewable energy source in reaction to the price advertised on slot t. A simple example is when y(t) can take one of two possible values, such as HIGH and LOW, representing different demand conditions (such as during peak times or non-peak times for requesting energy). Another example is when y(t) represents the number of consumers willing to purchase renewable energy on slot t. We assume the demand state y(t) is known at the beginning of each slot t (we show a particular case where y(t) does not need to be known after our algorithm is stated).</p><p>Every slot t, in addition to choosing the amount of energy x(t) purchased from outside sources, the renewable energy plant makes a binary decision b(t) ∈ {0, 1}, where b(t) = 1 represents a willingness to accept new requests on slot t, and b(t) = 0 means no requests will be accepted. If b(t) = 1 is chosen, the plant also chooses a per-unit-energy price p(t) within an interval 0 ≤ p(t) ≤ p max , where p max is a preestablished maximum price. The arriving requests a(t) are then influenced by the current price p(t), the current market price γ(t), and the current demand state y(t), according to a general demand function F (p, y, γ). Specifically, the values of a(t) are assumed to be conditionally i.i.d. over all slots with the same p(t), y(t), γ(t), and satisfy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">E {a(t)|p(t), y(t), γ(t), b(t) = 1} = F (p(t), y(t), γ(t))</formula><p>We assume the function F (p, y, γ) is continuous in p for each given y and γ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> We further assume the arrivals a(t) continue to be worst-case bounded by a max , regardless of p(t), y(t), γ(t). The queue iteration Q(t) still operates according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, with the understanding that a(t) is now influenced by the pricing decisions. Let φ(t) represent the instantaneous profit earned on slot t, defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">φ(t) = b(t)p(t)a(t) − γ(t)x(t)</formula><p>We now consider the following problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Maximize: φ (16) Subject to: 1) Q &lt; ∞ (17) 2) 0 ≤ x(t) ≤ x max ∀t (18) 3) b(t) ∈ {0, 1} , 0 ≤ p(t) ≤ p max ∀t (19)</formula><p>where φ is defined as the limiting time average profit:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">φ = lim t→∞ 1 t t−1 τ =0 E {φ(τ )}</formula><p>To solve the problem, we use the same queueing structure for Q(t) and Z(t) in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(6)</ref>, and the same Lyapunov function L(Θ(t)). However, we now consider the "penalty" −φ(t), and so the drift-plus-penalty technique seeks to choose a vector that minimizes a bound on:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">∆(Θ(t)) − V E {φ(t)|Θ(t)}</formula><p>Using the same analysis as Lemma 2, we can show the following bound on this drift-plus-penalty expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">∆(Θ(t)) − V E {φ(t)|Θ(t)} ≤ B −V E {b(t)p(t)F (p(t), y(t), γ(t)) − γ(t)x(t)|Θ(t)} +Q(t)E {b(t)F (p(t), y(t), γ(t)) − s(t) − x(t)|Θ(t)} +Z(t)E { − s(t) − x(t)|Θ(t)} (20)</formula><p>Our joint energy-allocation and pricing algorithm observes the current system state on each slot t, and chooses b(t), p(t), and x(t) to minimize the right-hand side of the above drift expression (given the observed Θ(t)). This reduces to the following: Every slot t, observe queues Q(t), Z(t), and observe s(t), γ(t), y(t). Then choose a price p(t) and an allocation x(t) as follows:</p><p>• (Pricing p(t)) Choose p(t) as the solution to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">Max: F (p(t), y(t), γ(t))(V p(t) − Q(t)) S.t.: 0 ≤ p(t) ≤ p max</formula><p>If the resulting maximum value is non-negative, choose b(t) = 1. Else choose b(t) = 0 so that no new requests are allowed on slot t. • (Allocating x(t)) Choose x(t) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(12)</ref>.</p><p>• (Queue Updates) Update Q(t) and Z(t) by (1) and (6). This pricing pricing policy does not need to know the demand state y(t) in the special case when F (p(t), y(t), γ(t)) = y(t) ˆ F (p(t), γ(t)), so that demand state simply scales the demand function. This pricing structure is similar to that considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> for wireless service providers.</p><p>Theorem 2: Assume that x max ≥ max <ref type="bibr">[a max , ]</ref>, and that Q(0) = Z(0) = 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Robustness to Non-i.i.d. Behavior</head><p>We first note that the deterministic bounds Q max , Z max , D max in Theorems 1 and 2 hold for all sample paths that satisfy (2), not just those with i.i.d. properties. This is because our proof used a sample path argument. Further, using the universal scheduling technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>[19] <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, we can show that for any (possibly non-i.i.d., non-ergodic) sample path, the same algorithms always yield performance within BT /V of the performance of a "genie aided" policy that makes decisions based on knowledge up to T slots into the future, for any integer T &gt; 0. This gap BT /V can be made arbitrarily small if we fix T and choose a large value of V , which also increases delay as O(V ). This analysis is omitted for brevity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Simulations on Real Data Sets</head><p>We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm on a six-month data set that we created by combining 10-minute average spot market prices γ(t) for Los Angeles area (LA1) from CAISO <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> and 10-minute energy production s(t) for a small subset of windfarms from the Western Wind resources Dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. We modeled the demand a(t) as i.i.d. over slots and uniformly distributed over the integers {0, 1, . . . , a max }. We executed the algorithm in 10-minute timeslots and experimented with different values of the parameters V, and the corresponding deadlines they generate. Here we present a subset of those results (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for more).</p><p>We compare the proposed algorithm against a simple greedy strategy "Purchase at deadline," which tries to use all the available resource s(t) and only buys from the spot market as a last resort if a deadline is reached. As can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, the proposed algorithm reduces the cost of the renewable supplier by approximately a factor of 2 in the tested six-month window. This is not surprising since the greedy strategy does not hedge for future high prices in the spot market while the proposed algorithm learns to proactively buy when the spot market prices are lower than typical and deadline violations seem probable. The high variability of the spot market prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> makes this advantage significant. The second observation, seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, is that the proposed algorithm has on average a much smaller delay than the deadline, which for our parameters was D max = 69.1 hours. On the contrary, the greedy algorithm makes many requests wait close to (or exactly at) the maximum allowed 69.1 hours. Note that 69.1 hours corresponds to 415 slots, and our algorithm maintains delays within 10 hours (60 slots), as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. We have used a slot size of 10 minutes because that was the granularity of the available data. If system updates are available every minute or less, then the slot size can be reduced by at least an order of magnitude.</p><p>Our results use = E {a(t)} = a max /2. We also conducted simulations with = 0, which does not require knowledge of E {a(t)}. While = 0 does not provide a finite delay guarantee, it still guarantees the same finite Q max . Together with FIFO service, this means that the worst case delay for requests that arrive at time t is given by the smallest integer T &gt; 0 such that t+T τ =t+1 s(τ ) ≥ Q max . While Purchase at deadline Lyapunov optimization <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Histogram of delay for the customers waiting in the service queues of the renewable energy supplier under the two algorithms (vertical axis in logarithmic scale). Case = 0 is not shown, but has max delay 14 hours, as compared with the = E {A(t)} case (shown) with max delay 9.5 hours.</p><p>there is no bound on this for general s(t) processes, it can still lead to small delays. Indeed, in the simulations it still maintained all delays under D max = 2.9 days (having a maximum experimental delay of 14 hours, as compared to 9.5 hours for the = E {a(t)} case). 5 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows it gives slightly better cost, particularly because it increases delay. Both Lyapunov optimization algorithms provided significantly better cost and delay as compared to the greedy algorithm. It should be noted that we did not compare against dynamic programming algorithms such as the one proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. While it is clear that a dynamic programming approach could solve this problem optimally if the statistics of the underlying processes were known, one benefit of our approach is that no such prior knowledge is required. Further, while we treat only the 1-queue case here, the Lyapunov approach can be used to provide an efficient algorithm for multiple queues corresponding to different customers with different deadlines.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
