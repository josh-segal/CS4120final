				<p>Today&apos;s networks typically handle traffic engineering (e.g., tuning the routing-protocol parameters to optimize the flow of traffic) and failure recovery (e.g., pre-installed backup paths) independently. In this paper, we propose a unified way to balance load efficiently under a wide range of failure scenarios. Our architecture supports flexible splitting of traffic over multiple precomputed paths, with efficient path-level failure detection and automatic load balancing over the remaining paths. We propose two candidate solutions that differ in how the routers rebalance the load after a failure , leading to a trade-off between router complexity and load-balancing performance. We present and solve the optimization problems that compute the configuration state for each router. Our experiments with traffic measurements and topology data (including shared risks in the underlying transport network) from a large ISP identify a &quot;sweet spot&quot; that achieves near-optimal load balancing under a variety of failure scenarios, with a relatively small amount of state in the routers. We believe that our solution for joint traffic engineering and failure recovery will appeal to Internet Service Providers as well as the operators of data-center networks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>To ensure uninterrupted data delivery, communication networks must distribute traffic efficiently even as links and routers fail and recover. By tuning routing to the offered traffic, traffic engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> improves performance and allows network operators to defer expensive outlays of new capacity. Effective failure recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>-adapting to failures by directing traffic over good alternate paths-is also important to avoid performance disruptions. However, today's networks typically handle failure recovery and traffic engineering independently, leading to more complex routers and less efficient paths after failures. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution with much simpler routers that balances load effectively under a range of failure scenarios.</p><p>We argue that traffic engineering and failure recovery can be achieved by the same underlying approach-dynamically rebalancing traffic across diverse end-to-end paths in response to individual failure events. This reduces the complexity of the routers by moving most functionality to the management system-an algorithm run by the network operator. Our network architecture has three key features:</p><p>Precomputed multipath routing: Traffic between each pair of edge routers is split over multiple paths that are configured in advance. The routers do not compute (or recompute) paths, reducing router overhead and improving path stability. Instead, the management system computes paths that offer sufficient diversity across a range of failure scenarios, including correlated failures of multiple links.</p><p>Path-level failure detection: The ingress routers perform failure recovery based only on which paths have failed. A minimalist control plane performs path-level failure detection and notification, in contrast to the link-level probing and network-wide flooding common in today's intradomain routing protocols. This leads to simpler, cheaper routers.</p><p>Local adaptation to path failures: Upon detecting path failures, the ingress router rebalances the traffic on the remaining paths, based only on which path(s) failed-not on load information. This avoids having the routers distribute real-time updates about link load and prevents instability. Instead, the management system precomputes the reactions to path failures and configures the routers accordingly.</p><p>The first two features-multiple precomputed paths and path-level monitoring-are ideas that have been surfacing (sometimes implicitly) in the networking literature over the past few years (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, and many others). Our architecture combines these two ideas in a new way, through (i) a specific proposal for the "division of labor" between the routers and the management system and (ii) an integrated view of traffic engineering and failure recovery within a single administrative domain. To support the simple network elements, the management system makes network-wide decisions based on the expected traffic, the network topology, and the groups of links that can fail together. The management system does not need to make these decisions in real time-quite the contrary, offline algorithms can compute the paths and the adaptations to path failures to ensure good performance.</p><p>Our architecture raises important questions about (i) what configuration state the routers should have to drive their local reactions to path failures and (ii) how the management system should compute this state, and the underlying paths, for good traffic engineering and failure recovery. In addressing these questions, we make four main contributions:</p><p>Simple architecture for joint TE and failure recovery (Section 2): We propose a joint solution for traffic engineering and failure recovery, in contrast to today's networks that handle these problems separately. Our minimalist control plane has routers balance load based only on path-failure information, in contrast to recent designs that require routers to disseminate link-load information and compute new path-splitting parameters in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</p><p>Network-wide optimization across failure scenarios (Section 3): We formulate and solve network-wide optimization problems for configuring the routers. Our algorithms compute (i) multiple paths that distribute traffic efficiently under a range of failure scenarios and (ii) the state for each ingress router to adapt to path failures. We present algorithms for two router designs that strike a different tradeoff between router state and load-balancing performance.</p><p>Experiments with measurement data from a large ISP (Section 4): We evaluate our algorithms on measurement data from a tier-1 ISP network. Our simulation achieves a high degree of accuracy by utilizing the real topology, link capacities, link delays, hourly traffic matrices, and Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Our experiments show that one of our candidate router designs achieves nearoptimal load balancing across a wide range of failure scenarios, even when the traffic demands change dynamically.</p><p>Deployability in ISP and data-center networks (Section 5): While our architecture enables simpler routers and switches, existing equipment can support our solutions. ISP backbones can use RSVP to signal multiple MPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> paths, with hash-based splitting of traffic over the paths. In data centers, the fabric controller can configure multiple paths through the network, and the server machines can encapsulate packets to split traffic in the desired proportions.</p><p>The paper ends with related work in Section 6, conclusion in Section 7, and supporting proofs in an Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SIMPLE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE</head><p>Our architecture uses simple, cheap routers to balance load before, during, and after failures by placing most functionality in a management system that performs offline optimization. The network-management system computes multiple diverse paths between each pair of edge routers, and tells each ingress router how to split traffic over these paths under a range of failure scenarios. Each edge router simply detects path-level failures and uses this information to adjust the splitting of traffic over the remaining paths, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The main novel feature of our architecture is the way routers split traffic over the working paths; we propose two approaches that introduce a trade-off between router state and load-balancing performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Precomputed Multipath Routing</head><p>Many existing routing protocols compute a single path between each pair of routers, and change that path in response to topology changes. However, dynamic routing has many downsides, including the overhead on the routers (to disseminate topology information and compute paths) and the transient disruptions during routing-protocol convergence. Techniques for making convergence faster tend to increase the complexity of the routing software and the overhead on the routers, by disseminating more information or updating it more quickly. Rather than trying to reduce convergence time, or add mechanisms to detect transient loops and blackholes, we avoid dynamic routing protocols entirely <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Our architecture uses multiple preconfigured paths between each pair of edge routers, allowing ingress routers to adapt to failures by shifting traffic away from failed path(s). With multiple paths through the network, the routers do not need to recompute paths dynamically-they simply stop using the failed paths until they start working again. This substantially reduces router software complexity and protocol overheads (e.g., bandwidth and CPU resources), while entirely side-stepping the problem of convergence. Instead, the management system computes these paths, based on both traffic-engineering and failure-recovery goals, and installs the paths in the underlying routers. The management system can select diverse paths that ensure connectivity in the face of failures, including multiple correlated failures.</p><p>Using multiple paths also leads to better load balancing, whether or not failures occur. Today's shortest-path routing protocols (like OSPF and IS-IS) use a single path, or (at best) only support even splitting of traffic over multiple shortest paths. Our architecture (like other recent proposals for multipath load balancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>) allows flexible splitting of traffic over multiple paths. However, we do not require dynamic adaptation of the traffic splitting. Instead, the ingress router has a simple static configuration that determines the splitting of traffic over the available paths, while intermediate routers merely forward packets over pre-established paths. The management system optimizes this configuration in advance based on a network-wide view of the expected traffic and likely failures. This avoids the protocol overhead and stability challenges of distributed, load-sensitive routing protocols. Also, the management system can use knowledge about shared risks and anticipated traffic demands-information the routers do not have.</p></div>

This approach requires small timers for fast failure detection, imposing additional overhead on the routers. In addition, many failures are triggered by planned maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, leading to two convergence events-one for the link failure(s), and another for the recovery-that both cause transient disruptions. In addition, "hello" messages do not detect all kinds of failuressome misconfigurations (e.g., having a maximum packet size that is too small) and attacks (e.g., an adversary selectively dropping packets) do not lead to lost "hello" messages. Instead, our architecture relies on path-level failure detection. Each ingress-egress router pair has a session to monitor each of its paths (e.g., as in BFD <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). The probes can be piggybacked on existing data traffic, obviating the need for separate "hello" messages when the path is carrying regular data traffic. This enables fast failure detection without introducing extra probe traffic, and the "implicit probes" provide a more realistic view of the reliability of a path <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, since the packets vary in size, addresses, and so on. Another advantage is that the packets are handled by the hardware interfaces and, as such, do not consume processing resources (or experience software processing delays) at intermediate routers. (Still, the propagation delay along a path does impose limits on detection time in large topologies, an issue we discuss in more detail in Section 5.)</p><p>Although the ingress router doesn't learn which link failed, knowledge of the path failures is sufficient to avoid the failed path. In fact, since the routers need not be aware of the topology, no control protocol is needed to exchange topology information. In fact, only some of the ingress routers need to learn about the failure-only the routers that have paths traversing the failed edge. The other ingress routers, and the intermediate routers, can remain unaware of the link failure. Of course, the management system ultimately needs to know about topology changes, so failed equipment can be fixed or replaced. But this detection problem can be handled on a much longer timescale since it does not affect the failure-recovery time for data traffic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Local Adaptation to Path Failures</head><p>In our architecture, a router is a simple device that does not participate in a routing protocol, collect congestion feedback, or solve any computationally difficult problems. Still, the routers do play an important role in adapting the distribution of traffic when paths fail or recover, at the behest of the management system. We propose two different ways the routers can split traffic over the working paths: (i) stateindependent splitting which has minimal router state and (ii) state-dependent splitting which introduces more state in exchange for near-optimal performance, as summarized (and compared to an idealized solution) in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Optimal load balancing: This idealized solution calculates the optimal paths and splitting ratios separately for each possible failure state, i.e., for each combination of link failures. This approach achieves the best possible load balancing by finding the optimal set of paths and splitting ratios. However, the approach is impractical because the routers must (i) store far too much state and (ii) learn about all link failures-even on links the router's paths do not traverse. Therefore, this solution would violate our architecture. However, the solution is still interesting as an upper bound on the performance of the other two schemes.</p><p>State dependent splitting: In this solution, each ingress router has a separate configuration entry with path-splitting weights for each combination of path failures to a particular egress router. For example, suppose a router has three paths to an egress router. Then, the router configuration contains seven entries-one for each of the 2 3 − 1 combinations of path failures. Each configuration entry, computed ahead of time by the management system, consists of three weightsone per path, with a 0 for any failed paths. Upon detecting path failures, the ingress router inspects a pre-configured table to select the appropriate weights for splitting the traffic destined to the egress router. Our experiments in Section 4 show that, even in a large ISP backbone, having three or four paths is sufficient, leading to modest state requirements on the router in exchange for near-optimal load balancing.</p><p>State independent splitting: This solution further simplifies the router configuration by having a single set of weights across all failure scenarios. So, an ingress router with three paths to an egress router would have only three weights, one for each path. If any paths fail, the ingress router simply renormalizes the traffic on the remaining paths. As such, the management system must perform a robust optimization of the limited configuration parameters to achieve good load-balancing performance across a range of failure scenarios. Our experiments in Section 4 show that this simple approach can perform surprisingly well, but understandably not as well as state-dependent splitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">NETWORK-WIDE OPTIMIZATION</head><p>In our architecture, the network-management system performs network-wide optimization to compute paths and trafficsplitting ratios that balance load effectively across a range of failure scenarios. In this section, we first discuss the information the management system has about the network topology, traffic demands, and shared risks. Then, we explain how the management system computes the multiple diverse paths and the traffic-splitting ratios, for both state-dependent and state-independent splitting. We solve all optimization problems either by formulating them as linear programs solvable in polynomial time, or by providing heuristics for solving NP-hard problems. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarizes the notation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Network-Wide Visibility and Control</head><p>The management system computes paths and splitting ratios based on a network-wide view:</p><p>Fixed topology: The management system makes decisions based on the designed topology of the network-the routers and links that have been deployed. The topology is represented by a graph G(V, E) with a set of vertices V and directed edges E. The capacity of edge e ∈ E is denoted by ce, and the propagation delay on the edge is ye.</p><p>Shared risk link groups: The management system knows which links share a common vulnerability, such as connecting to the same line card or router or traversing the same optical fiber or amplifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The shared risks are denoted by the set S, where each s ∈ S consists of a set of edges that may fail together. For example, a router failure is represented by the set of its incident links, a fiber cut is represented by all links in the affected fiber bundle, and the failure-free case is represented by the empty set ∅. Operators also have measurement data from past failures to produce estimates for the likelihood of different failures (e.g., an optical amplifier may fail less often than a line card). As such, each failure state s has a weight w s that represents its likelihood or importance.</p><p>Expected traffic demands: The management system knows the anticipated traffic demands, based on past measurements and predictions of traffic changes. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Each traffic demand d ∈ D is represented by a triple (u d , v d , h d ), where u d ∈ V is the traffic source (ingress router), v d ∈ V is</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">∈ S D set of demands u d source of demand d ∈ D v d destination of demand d ∈ D h d flow requirement of demand d ∈ D P d paths available to demand d ∈ D αp</formula><p>fraction of the demand assigned to path p  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Summary of notation (measured traffic). For simplicity, we assume that all demands remain connected for each failure scenario; alternatively, a demand can be omitted for each failure case that disconnects it. In practice, the management system may have a time sequence of traffic demands (e.g., for different hours in the day), and optimize the network configuration across all these demands, as we discuss in Section 4.3.</p><p>The management system's output is set of paths P d for each demand d and the splitting ratios for each path. In each failure state s, the traffic splitting by ingress router u d depends only on which paths have failed, not which failure scenario s has occurred; in fact, multiple failure scenarios may affect the same subset of paths in P d . To reason about the handling of a particular demand d, we consider a set O d of "observable" failure states, where each observable state o ∈ O d corresponds to a particular P o d ⊂ P d representing the available paths. For ease of expression, we let the function o d (s) map to the failure state observable by node u d when the network is in failure state s ∈ S. The amount of flow assigned to path p in observable failure state o ∈ O d is f o p . The total flow on edge e in failure state s is l s e , and the flow on edge e corresponding to demand d is l s e,d . The management system's goal is to compute paths and splitting ratios that minimize congestion over the range of possible failure states. A common traffic-engineering objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is to minimize e∈E Φ(l s e /ce) where le is the load on edge e and ce is its capacity. Φ() could be a convex function of link load <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, to penalize the most congested links while still accounting for load on the remaining links. The final objective minimizing congestion across failure scenarios is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">obj(l s 1 e 1 /ce 1 , ...) = s∈S w s e∈E Φ(l s e /ce).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Minimizing this objective function is the goal of all the candidate solutions in the following section. The constraints that complete the problem formulation differ depending on the functionality placed in the underlying routers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Computing Multiple Diverse Paths</head><p>The management system must compute multiple diverse paths that ensure good load balancing-and (most importantly) continued connectivity-across a range of failure scenarios. However, computing the optimal paths for statedependent and state-independent splitting is NP-hard. Instead, we propose a heuristic: using the collection of paths computed by the optimal solution that optimizes for each failure state independently. This guarantees that the paths are sufficiently diverse to ensure traffic delivery in all failure states, while also making efficient use of network resources.</p><p>The idealized optimal solution has a separate set of paths and splitting ratios in each failure state s. To avoid introducing explicit variables for exponentially many paths, we formulate the problem in terms of the amount of flow l s e,d</p><p>from demand d traversing edge e for failure state s. The optimal edge loads are obtained by solving a linear program:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min obj(l s 1 e 1 /ce 1 , ...) s.t. l s e = d∈D l s e,d</formula><p>∀s, e</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">0 = i:e=(i,j) l s e,d − i:e=(j,i) l s e,d ∀d, s, j = u d , v d h d = i:e=(u d ,i) l s e,d − i:e=(i,u d ) l s e,d ∀d, s 0 ≤ l s e,d ∀d, s, e,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where l s e and l s e,d are variables. The first constraint defines the load on edge e, the second constraint ensures flow conservation, the third constraint ensures that the demands are met, and the last constraint guarantees flow non-negativity. An optimal solution can be found in polynomial time using conventional techniques for solving multi-commodity flow problems.</p><p>After obtaining the optimal flow on each edge for all the failure scenarios, we use a standard decomposition algorithm to determine the corresponding paths P d and the flow f s p on each of them. The decomposition starts with a set P d that is empty. New unique paths are added to the set by performing the following decomposition for each failure state s. First, annotate each edge e with the value l s e,d . Remove all edges that have 0 value. Then, find a path connecting u d and v d . Although we could choose any of the paths from u d to v d , our goal is to obtain paths that are as short as possible. So, if multiple such paths exist, we use the path p with the smallest propagation delay. Add this path p to the set P d and assign to it flow f s p equal to the smallest value of the edges on path p. Reduce the values of these edges accordingly. Continue in this fashion, removing edges with zero value and finding new paths, until there are no remaining edges in the graph.</p><p>Note that we can show by induction that this process completely partitions the flow l s e,d into paths. The decomposition yields at most |E| paths for each network failure state s because the value of at least one edge becomes 0 whenever a new path is found. Hence the total size of the set P d is at most |E||S|. It is difficult to obtain a solution that restricts the number of paths as we prove in the appendix that it is NP-hard to solve problem (2) when the number of allowed paths is bounded by a constant J. In practice, the algorithm produces a relatively small number of paths between each pair of edge routers, as shown later in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Optimizing the Traffic-Splitting Ratios</head><p>Once the paths are computed, the network-management system can optimize the path-splitting ratios for each ingressegress router pair. The optimization problem and the resulting solution depend on whether the routers perform statedependent or state-independent splitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">State-Dependent Splitting</head><p>In state-dependent splitting, each ingress router u d has a set of splitting ratios for each observable failure state o ∈ O d . Since the path-splitting ratios depend on which paths in P d have failed, the ingress router must store splitting ratios for min(|S|, 2 |P d | ) scenarios; fortunately, the number of paths |P d | is typically small in practice. When the network performs such state-dependent splitting, the management system's goal is to find a set of paths P d for each demand and the flows f o p on these paths in all observable states o ∈ O d . If the paths P d are known and fixed, the problem can be formulated as a linear program:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">min obj(l s 1 e 1 /ce 1 , ...) s.t. l s e = d∈D p∈P o d ,e∈p f o p ∀e, s, o = o d (s) h d = p∈P o d f o p ∀d, o ∈ O d 0 ≤ f o p ∀d, o ∈ O d , p ∈ P d ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where l s e and f o p are variables. The first constraint defines the load on edge e, the second constraint guarantees that the demand d is satisfied in all observable failure states, and the last constraint ensures non-negativity of flows assigned to the paths. The solution of the optimization problem (3) can be found in polynomial time.</p><p>The problem becomes NP-hard if the sets of paths {P d } are not known in advance. In fact, as we show in the Appendix, it is NP-hard even to tell if two paths that allow an ingress router to distinguish two network failure states can be constructed. Therefore, it is NP-hard to construct the optimal set of paths for all our formulations that assume the sources do not have information about the network failure state s. Therefore, we use the paths that are found by the decomposition of the optimal solution (2), as outlined in the previous subsection. Since these paths allow optimal load balancing for the optimal solution (2), they are also likely to enable good load balancing for the optimization problem (3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">State-Independent Splitting</head><p>In state independent splitting, each ingress router has a single configuration entry containing the splitting ratios that are used under any combination of path failures. Each path p is associated with a splitting fraction αp. When one or more paths fail, the ingress router u d renormalizes the splitting parameters for the working paths to compute the fraction of traffic to direct to each of these paths. If the network elements implement such state-independent splitting, and the paths P d are known and fixed, the management system needs to solve the following non-convex optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">min obj(l s 1 e 1 /ce 1 , ...) s.t. f o p = h d αp q∈P o d αq ∀d, o ∈ O d , p ∈ P d l s e = d∈D p∈P o d ,e∈p f o p ∀e, s, o = o d (s) h d = p∈P o d f o p ∀d, o ∈ O d 0 ≤ f o p ∀d, o ∈ O d , p ∈ P d ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where l s e , f o p and αp are variables. The first constraint ensures that the flow assigned to every available path p is proportional to αp. The other three constraints are the same as in (3).</p><p>Unfortunately, no standard optimization techniques allow us to compute an optimal solution efficiently, even when the paths P d are fixed. Therefore, we have to rely on heuristics to find both the candidate paths P d and the splitting ratios αp. To find the set of candidate paths P d , we again use the optimal paths obtained by decomposing (2). To find the splitting ratios we mimic the behavior of the optimal solution as closely as possible. We find the splitting ratios for all paths p by letting αp = </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION</head><p>To evaluate the algorithms described in the previous section, we wrote a simulator in C++ that calls the CPLEX linear program solver in AMPL and solves the optimization problems (2) and (3). We compare our two heuristics to the optimal solution, a simple "equal splitting" configuration, and OSPF with the link weights set using state-of-the-art optimization techniques. We show that our two heuristics require few paths resulting in compact routing tables, and the round-trip propagation delay does not increase. Finally, using real traffic traces obtained during a 24-hour measurement in the network of a tier-1 ISP we show that our solutions achieve excellent results without the need to perform any reoptimizations even in the presence of a changing traffic matrix.</p><p>Our experimental results show that the objective value of state-dependent splitting very closely tracks the optimal objective. For this reason, this solution is our favorite. Although state-independent splitting has a somewhat worse performance especially as the network load increases beyond current levels, it is also attractive due to its simplicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>Our simulations use a variety of synthetic topologies, the Abilene topology, as well as the city-level IP backbone topology of a tier-1 ISP with a set of failures provided by the network operator. The parameters of the topologies we used are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. Synthetic topologies: The synthetic topologies include 2-level hierarchical graphs, purely random graphs, and Waxman graphs. 2-level hierarchical graphs are produced using the generator GT-ITM <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, for random graphs the probability of two edges being connected is constant, and the probability of having an edge between two nodes in the Waxman graph decays exponentially with the distance of the nodes. These topologies also appear in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Abilene topology: The topology of the Abilene network and a measured traffic matrix are used. We use the true edge capacities of 10 Gbps. Tier-1 IP backbone: The city-level IP backbone of a tier-1 ISP is used. In our simulations, we use the real link capacities and measured traffic demands. We also obtained the link round-trip propagation delays.</p><p>The collection of network failures S for the synthetic topologies and Abilene contains single edge failures and the nofailure case. Two experiments with different collections of failures are performed on the tier-1 IP backbone. In the first experiment, single edge failures are used. In the second experiment, the collection of failures also contains Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs), link failures that occur simulta-  neously. SRLGs were obtained from the network operator's database that contains 954 failures with the largest failure affecting 20 links simultaneously. For each potential line card failure, a complete router failure, or a link cut there is a corresponding record in the SRLG database. Therefore, failures that do not appear in the database are rare. The weights w s in the optimization objective (1) were set to 0.5 for the no-failure case, and all other failure weights are equal and sum to 0.5. The set of demands D in the Abilene and tier-1 networks were obtained by sampling Netflow data measured on Nov. 15th 2005 and May 22nd 2009, respectively. For the synthetic topologies, we chose the same traffic demands as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>To simulate the algorithms in environments with increasing congestion, we repeat all experiments several times while uniformly increasing the traffic demands. For the synthetic topologies we start with the original demands and scale them up to twice the original values. As the average link utilization in Abilene and the tier-1 topology is lower than in the synthetic topologies, we scale the demands in these realistic topologies up to three times the original value.</p><p>In our experiments we use the piecewise linear penalty function defined by Φ(0) = 0 and its derivatives:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Φ () =              1 for 0 ≤ &lt; 0.333 3</formula><p>for 0.333 ≤ &lt; 0.667 10 for 0.667 ≤ &lt; 0.9 70 for 0.9 ≤ &lt; 1 500 for 1 ≤ &lt; 1.1 5000 for 1.1 ≤ &lt; ∞ This penalty function was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The function can be viewed as modeling retransmission delays caused by packet losses. The cost is small for low utilization, and increases steeply as the utilization exceeds 100%.</p><p>Our simulation calculates the objective value of the optimal solution, state-independent and state-dependent splitting, and equal splitting. Equal splitting is a variant of stateindependent splitting that splits the flow evenly on the available paths. We also calculate the objective achieved by the shortest path routing of OSPF with optimized link weights. These link weights were calculated using the state-of-the-art optimizations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and these optimizations take into consideration the set of failure states S and the corresponding failure weights w s .</p><p>Our simulations were performed using CPLEX version 11.2 on a 1.5 GHz Intel Itanium 2 processor. Solving the linear program (2) for a particular failure case in the tier-1 topology takes 4 seconds, and solving the linear program (3) takes about 16 minutes. A tier-1 network operator can perform calculations for its entire city-level topology in less than 2 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Performance with Static Traffic</head><p>Avoiding congestion and packet losses during planned and unplanned failures is the central goal of traffic engineering. Our traffic engineering objective measures congestion across all the considered failure cases. The objective as a function of the scaled-up demands is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>. The results which were obtained on the hierarchical and tier-1 topologies are representative, we made similar observations for all the other topologies. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>, the performance of state-dependent splitting and the optimal solution is virtually indistinguishable in all cases. State-independent splitting is less sophisticated and does not allow custom load   balancing ratios for distinct failures, and therefore its performance is worse compared to the optimum. However, the performance compares well with that of OSPF. Unlike OSPF, state-independent splitting benefits from using the same set of paths as the optimal solution. It is not surprising that the equal splitting algorithm achieves the worst performance. We observe that OSPF achieves a somewhat worse performance than state-independent and state-dependent splitting as the load increases. We made this observation despite the fact that we obtained a custom set of OSPF link weights for each network load we evaluated. A possible explanation is that OSPF routing, in which each router splits the load evenly between the smallest weight paths, does not allow enough flexibility in choosing routes and splitting ratios.</p><p>Solutions with few paths are preferred as they decrease the number of tunnels that have to be managed, and reduce the size of the router configuration. However, a sufficient number of paths must be available to avoid failures and to reduce congestion. We observe that the number of paths used by our algorithms is small. We record the number of paths used by each demand, and plot the distribution in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref>. Not surprisingly, the number of paths is greater for larger and more diverse topologies. 92% of the demands in the hierarchical topology use 7 or fewer paths, and fewer than 10 paths are needed in the tier-1 backbone topology for almost all demands. Further, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref> shows that the number of paths only increases slightly as we scale up the amount of traffic in the networks. This small increase is caused by shifting some traffic to longer paths as the short paths become congested.</p><p>A practical solution uses few MPLS labels in order to reduce the size of routing tables in the routers. Our experimental results reveal that when we use MPLS tunnels in the tier-1 topology, a few thousand tunnels can pass through a single router. However, a simple routing table compression technique allows us to reduce the routing table size to a few hundred entries in each router. Such compression is important because it reduces the memory requirements imposed on the simple routers whose use we advocate, and it improves the route lookup time.</p><p>Routing tables can be compressed by using the same MPLS labels for routes with a common path to the destination. Specifically, if two routes to destination t pass through router r, and these routes share the same path between the router r and the destination t, the same outbound label should be used in the routing table of router r. The resulting routing table sizes as a function of the network load are depicted in    Minimizing the delay experienced by the users is another important goal of network operators. We calculated the average round-trip propagation delays of all the evaluated algorithms. The calculated delays include delays in all failure states weighted by the corresponding likelihood of occurrence, but exclude congestion delay which is negligible. The delays are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>. We observe that the round-trip delay of all algorithms except equal splitting is almost identical at around 31 ms. These values would satisfy the 37 ms requirement specified in the SLAs of the tier-1 network. Moreover, these values are not higher than these experienced by the network users today. To demonstrate this, we repeated our simulation on the tier-1 topology using the real OSPF weights which are used by the network operator. These values are chosen to provide a tradeoff between traffic engineering and shortest delay routing. The results which appear in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> in the row titled OSPF (current) show that the current delays are 31.38 ms for each of the two tier-1 failure sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Robust Optimization for Dynamic Traffic</head><p>Solving the optimization problems repeatedly as the traffic matrix changes is undesirable due to the need to update the router configurations with new paths and splitting ratios. We explore the possibility of using a single router configuration that is robust to diurnal changes of the demands.</p><p>To perform this study we collected hourly netflow traffic traces in the tier-1 network on September 29, 2009. We denote the resulting 24 hourly traffic matrices D 0 , D 1 , ..., D <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref> depicts the aggregate traffic volume, as well as example of the traffic between three ingress-egress router pairs. The aggregate traffic volume is the lowest at 9 a.m. GMT and peaks with 2.5 times as much traffic at midnight and 8 p.m. GMT. Comparison to the three depicted ingress-egress router demands reveals that the traffic during a day cannot be obtained by simple scaling as the individual demands peak at different times. This makes the joint optimization challenging.</p><p>The first step in the joint optimization is to calculate a single set of paths that guarantee failure resilience and load balancing for each of the 24 traffic matrices. There are several approaches we can take. In the first approach, we solve linear program (2) for each traffic matrix D i separately and use the union of the paths obtained for each matrix. The    <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(2)</ref> is then solved for the average traffic matrix. In the third approach we use the envelope of the 24 traffic matrices instead of the average, i.e., we let D jk = maxiD i jk . In our simulations we chose the last method. Compared to the first method, it results in fewer paths. Compared to the second method, it allows better load balancing because demands between ingress-egress pairs with high traffic variability throughout the day are represented by the peak traffic.</p><p>The second step is to calculate router configuration robust to traffic changes. We again use the envelope D jk = maxiD i jk as the input traffic matrix and repeat the optimizations from the previous section. Then we test the solution by simulating the varying traffic demand during one day period. The resulting objective value of state dependent splitting and state independent splitting is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref>. The optimal objective in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref> represents the performance of the best possible solution that uses custom configuration updated hourly. We observe that state dependent splitting with a single configuration is robust to diurnal traffic changes and the value of its objective closely tracks the optimum. State independent splitting is also close to optimal during low congestion periods, but becomes suboptimal during the peak hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS</head><p>Although our architecture enables the use of new simpler routers, we can readily deploy our solutions using existing protocols and equipment, as summarized in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. An ISP can deploy our architecture using Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Data centers could use the same solution, or leverage existing Ethernet switches and move some functionality into the end-host machines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">ISP Backbone Using MPLS</head><p>Installing MPLS paths with RSVP: MPLS is particularly suitable because ingress routers encapsulate pack-  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Existing tools and protocols that can be used to deploy our architecture.</p><p>ets with labels and direct them over pre-established LabelSwitched Paths (LSPs). This enables flexible routing when multiple LSPs are established between each ingress-egress router pair. Our solution, then, could be viewed as a particular application of MPLS, where the management system computes the LSPs, instructs the ingress routers to establish the paths (say, using RSVP), and disables any dynamic recalculation of alternate paths when primary paths fail.</p><p>Hash-based splitting at ingress routers: Multipath forwarding is supported by commercial routers of both major vendors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. The routers can be configured to hash packets based on port and address information in the headers into several groups and forward each group on a separate path. This provides path splitting with relatively fine granularity (e.g., at the 1/16th level), while preventing out-oforder packet by delivery by ensuring that packets belonging to the same TCP or UDP flow traverse the same path.</p><p>Path-level failure detection using BFD: Fast failure detection can be done using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. A BFD session can monitor each path between two routers, by piggybacking on the existing data traffic. (Backbones covering a large geographic region may also use existing link-level detection mechanisms for even faster recovery. For example, local path protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> installs a short alternate path between two adjacent routers, for temporary use after the direct link fails. However, local protection cannot fully exploit the available path diversity, leading to suboptimal load balancing; instead, local protection can be used in conjunction with our design.)</p><p>Failure recovery at ingress router: The ingress router adapts to path failures by splitting traffic over the remaining paths. In state-independent splitting, the ingress router has a single set of traffic-splitting weights, and automatically renormalizes to direct traffic over the working paths. State-dependent splitting requires modification to the router software to switch to alternate traffic-splitting weights in the data plane; no hardware modifications are required.</p><p>Measuring traffic demands using SNMP: MPLS has SNMP counters (called Management Information Bases) that measure the total traffic traversing each Label-Switched Path. The management system can poll these counters to measure the traffic demands. Alternative measurement techniques, such as Netflow or tomography, may also be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Data Center Using Hosts and Switches</head><p>While a data center could easily use the same MPLS-based solution, control over the end host and the availability of cheaper commodity switches enable another solution.</p><p>End-host support for monitoring and traffic splitting: The server machines in data centers can perform many of the path-level operations in our architecture. As in the VL2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and SPAIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> architectures, the end host can encapsulate the packets (say, using a VLAN tag) to direct them over a specific path. This enables much finer-grain traffic splitting. In addition, the end host can perform path-level probing in the data plane, by piggybacking on existing data traffic and sending additional active probes when needed. Upon detecting path failures, the end host can change to new path-splitting percentages based on the precomputed configuration installed by the controller. The end host could also measure the traffic demands by keeping counts of the traffic destined to each egress switch. These functions can be implemented in the hypervisor, such as the virtual switch that often runs on server machines in data centers.</p><p>Multiple VLANs or OpenFlow rules for forwarding: The remaining functions can be performed by the underlying switches. For example, the management system can configure multiple paths by merging these paths into a set of trees, where each tree corresponds to a different VLAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Or, if the switches support the emerging OpenFlow standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, the management system could install a forwarding-table rule for each hop in each path, where the rule matches on the VLAN tag, and forwards the packet to the appropriate output port. Since OpenFlow switches maintain traffic counters for each rule, the management system can measure the traffic demands by polling the switches, in lieu of the end hosts collecting these measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">RELATED WORK</head><p>Traffic engineering: Most of the related work treats failure recovery and traffic engineering independently. Traffic engineering without failure recovery in the context of MPLS is studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> utilizes traffic splitting to minimize end-to-end delay and loss rates; however, an algorithm for optimal path selection is not provided. The works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> minimize the maximum link utilization while satisfying the requested traffic demands. Other papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> prevent congestion by adaptively balancing the load among multiple paths based on measurements of congestion, whereas our solution precomputes traffic-splitting configurations based on both the offered traffic and the likely failures.</p><p>Failure recovery: Local and global path protection are popular failure recovery mechanisms in MPLS. In local protection the backup path takes the shortest path that avoids the outage location from a point of local repair to the merge point with the primary path. The IETF RFC 4090 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> focuses on defining signaling extensions to establish the backup paths, but leaves the issues of bandwidth reservation and optimal route selection open. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> the shortest path that avoids the failure is used. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> attempt to find optimal backup paths with the goal of reducing congestion, local path protection is less suitable for traffic engineering than global path protection, which allows rerouting on end-to-end paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Other work describes how to manage restoration bandwidth and select optimal paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. While our solution also uses global protection to reroute around failures, the biggest difference is that most of the related work distinguishes primary and backup paths and only uses a backup path when the primary path fails. In contrast, our solution balances the load across multiple paths even before failures occur, and simply adjusts the splitting ratios in response to failures.</p><p>Integrated failure recovery and TE: Previous results that integrate failure recovery with routing on multiple paths only use alternate paths when primary routes fail <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, or they require explicit congestion feedback and do not provide algorithms to find the optimal paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. YAMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> constructs a set of diverse paths in the interdomain routing setting that are resilient against a specified set of failures, but without regard to load balancing. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> they integrate failure recovery with load balancing, but their focus is different-they guarantee delivery of a certain fraction of the traffic after a single edge failure, whereas our goal is to deliver all traffic for a known set of multi-edge failures. Proposals that optimize OSPF or IS-IS link weights with failures in mind, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, must rely on shortest path IGP routing and therefore cannot fully utilize the path diversity in the network.</p><p>Failure recovery and TE with multiple spanning trees: Enterprise and data-center networks often use Ethernet switches, which do do not scale well because all traffic flows over a single spanning tree, even if multiple paths exist. Several papers propose more scalable Ethernet designs that use multiple paths. The work of Sharma et al. uses VLANs to exploit multiple spanning trees to improve link utilization, and achieve improved fault recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Most of the designs such as VL2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and PortLand <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> rely on equal splitting of traffic on paths with the same cost. SPAIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> supports multipath routing through multiple spanning trees, with end hosts splitting traffic over the multiple paths. However, the algorithm for computing the paths does not consider the traffic demands, and the end hosts must play a stronger role in deciding which path to use for each individual flow based on the observed performance.</p><p>NP-hardness: Hardness proofs of optimization problems related to failure recovery appear, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we propose a mechanism that combines path protection and traffic engineering to enable reliable data delivery in the presence of link failures. We formalize the problem by providing several optimization-theoretic formulations that differ in the capabilities they require of the network routers. For each of the formulations, we present algorithms and heuristics that allow the network operator to find a set of optimal end-to-end paths and load balancing rules.</p><p>Our extensive simulations on the IP backbone of a tier-1 ISP and on a range of synthetic topologies demonstrate the attractive properties of our solutions. First, state-dependent splitting achieves load balancing performance close to the theoretical optimum, while state-independent splitting often offers comparable performance and a very simple setup. Second, using our solutions does not significantly increase propagation delay compared to the shortest path routing of OSPF. Finally, our solution is robust to diurnal traffic changes and a single configuration suffices to provide good performance.</p><p>In addition to failure resilience and favorable traffic engineering properties, our architecture has the potential to simplify router design and reduce operation costs for ISPs as well as operators of data centers and enterprise networks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. PROOFS</head><p>This Appendix shows that two problems are NP-hard:</p><p>Failure State Distinguishing instance: A directed graph G = (V, E), a source and destination vertices u, v ∈ V , and two sets s, s ⊆ E. question: Is there a simple directed path P from u to v that contains edges from one and only one of the sets s and s ?</p><p>Bounded Path Load Balancing instance: A directed graph G = (V, E) with a positive rational capacity ce for each edge e ∈ E, a collection S of subsets s ⊆ E of failure states with a rational weight w s for each s ∈ S, a set of triples (u d , v d , h d ), 1 ≤ d ≤ k, corresponding to demands, where h d units of demand d need to be sent from source vertex u d ∈ V to destination vertex v d ∈ V , an integer bound J on the number of paths that can be used between any source-destination pair, a piecewiselinear increasing cost function Φ() mapping edge loads to rationals, and an overall cost bound B. question: Are there J (or fewer) paths between each sourcedestination pair such that the given demands can be assigned to the paths so that the cost (sum of Φ() over all edges and weighted failure states as described in the text) is B or less?</p><p>To prove that a problem X is NP-hard, we must show that for some known NP-hard problem Y , any instance y of Y can be transformed into an instance x of X in polynomial time, with the property that the answer for y is yes if and only if the answer for x is yes. Both our problems can be proved NP-hard by transformations from the following problem, proved NP-hard by Fortune, Hopcroft, and Wyllie <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Disjoint Directed Paths instance: A directed graph G(V, E) and distinguished vertices u1, v1, u2, v2 ∈ V . question: Are there directed paths P1 from u1 to v1 and P2 from u2 to v2 such that P1 and P2 are vertex-disjoint? Theorem 1. The Failure State Distinguishing problem is NP-hard.</p><p>Proof. Suppose we are given an instance G = (V, E), u1, v1, u2, v2 of Disjoint Directed Paths. Our constructed instance of Failure State Distinguishing consists of the graph G = (V, E ), where E = E ∪ {(v1, u2)}, with u = u1, v = v2, s = φ, and s = {(v1, u2)}.</p><p>Given this choice of s and s , a simple directed path from u to v that distinguishes the two states must contain the edge (v1, u2). We claim that such a path exists if and only if there are vertex-disjoint directed paths P1 from u1 to v1 and P2 from u2 to v2. Suppose a distinguishing path P exists. Then it must consist of of three segments: a path P1 from u = u1 to v1, the edge (v1, u2), and then a path P2 from u2 to v = v2. Since it is a simple path, P1 and P2 must be vertex-disjoint. Conversely, if vertex-disjoint paths P1 from u1 to v1 and P2 from u2 to v2 exist, then the path P that concatenates P1 followed by (v1, u2) followed by P2 is our desired distinguishing path.</p><p>Theorem 2. The Bounded Path Load Balancing problem is NP-hard even if there are only two commodities (k = 2), only one path is allowed for each (J = 1), and there is only one failure state s.</p><p>Proof. For this result we use the variant of Disjoint Directed Paths in which we ask for edge-disjoint rather than vertex-disjoint paths. The NP-hardness of this variant is easy to prove, using a construction in which each vertex x of G is replaced by a pair of new vertices inx and outx, and each edge (x, y) is replaced by the edge (outx, iny).</p><p>Suppose we are given an instance G = (V, E), u1, v1, u2, v2 of the edge-disjoint variant of Disjoint Directed Paths. Our constructed instance of Bounded Path Load Balancing is based on the same graph, with each edge e given capacity ce = 1, with the single failure state s = φ (i.e., the state with no failures), with w s = 1, and with demands represented by the triples (u1, v1, 1) and (u2, v2, 1). The cost function Φ has derivative Φ () = 1, 0 ≤ ≤ 1, and Φ () = |E|, &gt; 1. Our target overall cost bound is B = |E|.</p><p>If the desired disjoint paths exist, we can use P1 to send the required unit of traffic from u1 to v1, and P2 to send the required unit of traffic from u2 to v2. Since the paths are edge-disjoint, no edge will carry more than one unit of traffic, so the cost per edge used is 1, and the total number of edges used is at most |E|. Thus the specified cost bound B = |E| is met. On the other hand, if no such pair of paths exist, then we must choose paths P1 and P2 that share at least one edge, which will carry two units of flow, for an overall cost of at least |E| + 1, just for that edge. Thus if there is a solution with cost |E| or less, the desired disjoint paths must exist.</p><p>Adding more paths, failure states, or commodities cannot make the problem easier. Note, however, that this does not imply that the problem for the precise cost function Φ presented in the text is NP-hard. It does, however, mean that, assuming P = NP, any efficient algorithm for that Φ would have to exploit the particular features of that function.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The management system calculates a fixed set of paths and splitting ratios, based on the topology, traffic demands, and potential failures.

The curve on the top shows the size of the largest routing table, and the curve on the bottom shows the average routing table size among all the backbone routers. Minimizing the delay experienced by the users is another important goal of network operators. We calculated the average round-trip propagation delays of all the evaluated algorithms. The calculated delays include delays in all failure states weighted by the corresponding likelihood of occurrence, but exclude congestion delay which is negligible. The delays are summarized in Table 4. We observe that the round-trip delay of all algorithms except equal splitting is almost identical at around 31 ms. These values would satisfy the 37 ms requirement specified in the SLAs of the tier-1 network. Moreover, these values are not higher than these experienced by the network users today. To demonstrate this, we repeated our simulation on the tier-1 topology using the real OSPF weights which are used by the network operator. These values are chosen to provide a tradeoff between traffic engineering and shortest delay routing. The results which appear in Table 4 in the row titled OSPF (current) show that the current delays are 31.38 ms for each of the two tier-1 failure sets.</figDesc></figure>
