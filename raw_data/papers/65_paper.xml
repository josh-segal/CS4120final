				<p>To understand how high rates of churn and random departure decisions of end-users affect connectivity of P2P networks , this paper investigates resilience of random graphs to lifetime-based node failure and derives the expected delay before a user is forcefully isolated from the graph and the probability that this occurs within his/her lifetime. Our results indicate that systems with heavy-tailed lifetime distributions are more resilient than those with light-tailed (e.g., exponential) distributions and that for a given average degree , k-regular graphs exhibit the highest resilience. As a practical illustration of our results, each user in a system with n = 100 billion peers, 30-minute average lifetime, and 1-minute node-replacement delay can stay connected to the graph with probability 1 − 1/n using only 9 neighbors. This is in contrast to 37 neighbors required under previous mod-eling efforts. We finish the paper by showing that many P2P networks are almost surely (i.e., with probability 1 − o(1)) connected if they have no isolated nodes and derive a simple model for the probability that a P2P system partitions under churn.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Resilience of random graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and various types of deterministic networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> has attracted significant attention in research literature. A classical problem in this line of study is to understand failure conditions under which the network disconnects and/or starts to offer noticeably lower performance (such as increased routing distance) to its users. To this end, many existing models assume uniformly random edge/node failure and derive the conditions under which each user <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, certain components <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, or the entire graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> stay connected after the failure.</p><p>Current analysis of P2P networks frequently adopts the same model of uniform, concurrent node failure and ranges from single-node isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> to disconnection of the entire graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>; however, these studies rarely discuss the scenarios under which large quantities of P2P users may simultaneously fail or how to accurately estimate failure probability p in practical systems such as KaZaA or Gnutella. 1 Another popular model assumes the existence of a rogue entity that compromises arbitrary nodes in the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and additional P2P studies examine such metrics as the required rate of neighbor replacement to avoid disconnection <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and the delay before the system recovers from inconsistencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>It has been recently noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that realistic P2P failure models should take into account the intrinsic behavior of Internet users, who depart from the network based on a combination of factors often more complex than the traditional binary metric. In these networks, failure develops when users voluntarily decide to leave the system based on their attention span and/or browsing habits. To examine the behavior of such systems, this paper introduces a simple node-failure model based on user lifetimes and studies the resilience of P2P networks in which nodes stay online for random periods of time. In this model, each arriving user is assigned a random lifetime L i drawn from some distribution F (x), which reflects the behavior of the user and represents the duration of his/her services (e.g., forwarding queries, sharing files) to the P2P community.</p><p>We start our investigation with the passive lifetime model in which failed neighbors are not continuously replaced. It is interesting to observe that even in this case, a large fraction of nodes are capable of staying online for their entire lifespan without suffering an isolation. Furthermore, we show that depending on the tail-weight of the lifetime distribution, the probability of individual node isolation can be made arbitrarily small without increasing node degree. While the passive model certainly allows P2P networks to evolve as long as newly arriving nodes replenish enough broken links in the system, most practical P2P networks employ special neighbor-recovery strategies and attempt to repair the failed segments of the graph. We thus subsequently study the active model where each failed neighbor is replaced with another node after some random search delay. For this scenario, we derive both the expected time to isolation E <ref type="bibr">[T ]</ref> and the probability π that this event occurs within the lifetime of a user.</p><p>In contrast to the p-percent failure model, the lifetime framework does not require estimation of such intricate metrics as the exact value of p or even the shape of the lifetime distribution. Towards the end of the paper, we show a reasonably good upper bound on π that only requires the mean user lifetime and the average node-replacement delay, both of which are easily measurable in existing systems.</p><p>Note that throughout most of the paper, "resilience" generally refers to the ability of an arriving user i to stay connected to the rest of the graph for duration L i while its neighbors are constantly changing. This is arguably the most transparent and relevant metric from the end-user's perspective; however, to complete the picture we also address global resilience where we informally show that tightly connected graphs (such as DHTs and many k-regular random graphs) partition with at least one isolated node with probability 1 − o(1) as the size of the network n → ∞. This result demonstrates that metric π solely determines the probability that an evolving P2P network partitions under churn and that global disconnection of such graphs for sufficiently small π almost surely involves a single node.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">LIFETIME-BASED NODE FAILURE</head><p>In this section, we introduce our model of node failure and explain the assumptions used later in the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Lifetime Model and Paper Overview</head><p>In the discussion that follows, we consider k-regular P2P graphs and analyze the probability that a randomly selected node v is forced to disconnect from the system because all of its neighbors have simultaneously departed and left it with no way to route within the graph. For each user i in the system, let L i be the amount of time that the user stays in the network searching for content, browsing for information, or providing services to other peers. It has been observed that the distribution of user lifetimes in real P2P systems is often heavy-tailed (i.e., Pareto) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, where most users spend minutes per day browsing the network while a handful of other peers exhibit server-like behavior and keep their computers logged in for weeks at a time. To allow arbitrarily small lifetimes, we use a shifted Pareto distribution F (x) = 1 − (1 + x/β) −α , x &gt; 0, α &gt; 1 to represent heavy-tailed user lifetimes, where scale parameter β &gt; 0 can change the mean of the distribution without affecting its range <ref type="bibr">(0, ∞]</ref>. Note that the mean of this distribution E[Li] = β/(α − 1) is finite only if α &gt; 1, which we assume holds in the rest of the paper. While our primary goal is the study of humanbased P2P systems, we also aim to keep our results universal and applicable to other systems of non-human devices and software agents where the nodes may exhibit non-Pareto distributions of L i . Thus, throughout the paper, we allow a variety of additional user lifetimes ranging from heavy-tailed to exponential.</p><p>The most basic question a joining user may ask about the resilience of lifetime-based P2P systems is what is the probability that I can outlive all of my original neighbors? We call this model "passive" since it does not involve any neighbor replacement and study it in fair detail in the next section. This model arises when the search time S to find neighbor replacement is prohibitively high (i.e., significantly above E[L i ]) or when peers intentionally do not attempt to repair broken links. If degree k is sufficiently large, it is intuitively clear that a given node v is not likely to out-survive k other peers; however, it is interesting to observe that Pareto distributions of Li make this probability significantly smaller compared to the "baseline" exponential case.</p><p>In a later part of the paper, we allow users to randomly (with respect to the lifetime of other peers) search the system for new neighbors once the failure of an existing neighbor is detected. We call this model "active" to contrast the actions of each user with those in the passive model. Defining W (t) to be the degree of v at time t, the difference between the passive and active models is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, which shows the evolution of W (t) and the isolation time T for both models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Modeling Assumptions</head><p>To keep the derivations tractable, we impose the following restrictions on the system. We first assume that v joins a network that has evolved sufficiently long so as to overcome any transient effects and allow asymptotic results from renewal process theory to hold. This assumption is usually satisfied in practice since P2P systems continuously evolve for hundreds of days or weeks before being restarted (if ever) and the average lifetime E[L i ] is negligible compared to the age of the whole system when any given node joins it.</p><p>Our second modeling assumption requires certain stationarity of lifetime L i . This means that users joining the system at different times of the day or month have their lifetimes drawn from the same distribution F (x). While it may be argued that users joining late at night browse the network longer (or shorter) than those joining in the morning, our results below can be easily extended to non-stationary environments and used to derive upper/lower bounds on the performance of such systems.</p><p>Finally, we should note that these stationarity assumptions do not apply to the number of nodes n, which we allow to vary with time according to any arrival/departure process as long as n 1 stays sufficiently large. We also allow arbitrary routing changes in the graph over time and are not concerned with the routing topology or algorithms used to forward queries. Thus, our analysis is applicable to both structured (i.e., DHTs) and unstructured P2P systems. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PASSIVE LIFETIME MODEL</head><p>We start by studying the resilience of dynamic P2P systems under the assumption that users do not attempt to replace the failed neighbors. As we show below, this analysis can be reduced to basic renewal process theory; however, its application to P2P networks is novel. Due to limited space, we omit the proofs of certain straightforward lemmas and refer the reader to the technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Model Basics</head><p>We first examine the probability that a node v can outlive k randomly selected nodes if all of them joined the system at the same time. While the answer to this question is trivial, it provides a lower-bound performance of the system and helps us explain the more advanced results that follow.</p><p>Lemma 1. The probability that node v has a larger lifetime than k randomly selected nodes is 1/(k + 1).</p><p>Consider an example of Chord <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> with neighbor table size equal to log 2 n, where n is the total number of nodes in the P2P network. Thus, in a system with 1 million nodes, the probability that a randomly selected node outlives log 2 n other peers is approximately 4.8%. This implies that with probability 95.2%, a user v does not have to replace any of its neighbors to remain online for the desired duration L v .</p><p>Note, however, that in current P2P networks, it is neither desirable nor possible for a new node v to pick its neighbors such that their arrival times are exactly the same as v's. Thus, when v joins a P2P system, it typically must randomly select its k neighbors from the nodes already present in the network. These nodes have each been alive for some random amount of time before v's arrival, which may or may not affect the remainder of their online presence. In fact, the tail-weight of the distribution of L i will determine whether v's neighbors are likely to exhibit longer or shorter remaining lives than v itself.</p><p>Throughout the paper, we assume that neighbor selection during join and replacement is independent of 1) neighbors' lifetimes L i or 2) their current ages A i . The first assumption clearly holds in most systems since the nodes themselves do not know how long the user plans to browse the network. Thus, the value of Li is generally hard to correlate with any other metric (even under adversarial selection). The second assumption holds in most current DHTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and unstructured graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> since neighbor selection depends on a variety of factors (such as a uniform hashing function of the DHT space <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, random walks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, interest similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, etc.), none of which are correlated with node age.</p><p>The above assumptions allow one to model the time when v selects each of its k neighbors to be uniformly random within each neighbor's interval of online presence. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(a), where tv is the join time of node v, and a i and d i are the arrival and departure times of neighbor i, respectively. Since the system has evolved for sufficiently long before v joined, the probability that v finds neighbor i at any point within the interval <ref type="bibr">[ai, di]</ref> can be modeled as equally likely. This is schematically shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(b) for four neighbors of v, whose intervals [a i , d i ] are independent of each other or the value of t v .</p><p>Next, we formalize the notion of residual lifetimes and examine under what conditions the neighbors are more likely to outlive each joining node v. Define Ri = di − tv to be the remaining lifetime of neighbor i when v joined the system. As before, let F (x) be the CDF of lifetime L i . Assuming that n is large and the system has reached stationarity, the CDF of residual lifetimes is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">FR(x) = P (Ri &lt; x) = 1 E[Li] x 0 (1 − F (z))dz.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>For exponential lifetimes, the residuals are trivially exponential using the memoryless property of F (x): F R (x) = 1 − e −λx ; however, the next result shows that the residuals of Pareto distributions with shape α are more heavy-tailed and exhibit shape parameter α − 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 2. The CDF of residuals for Pareto lifetimes with</head><formula xml:id="formula_1">F (x) = 1 − (1 + x/β) −α , α &gt; 1 is given by: F R (x) = 1 − 1 + x β 1−α .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This outcome is not surprising as it is well-known that heavy-tailed distributions exhibit "memory," which means that users who survived in the system for some time t &gt; 0 are likely to remain online for longer periods of time than the arriving users. In fact, the larger the current age of a peer, the longer he/she is expected to remain online. The occurrence of this "heavy-tailed" phenomenon in P2P systems is supported by experimental observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and can also be explained on the intuitive level. If a user v has already spent 10 hours in the system, it is generally unlikely that he/she will leave the network in the next 5 minutes; however, the same probability for newly arriving peers is substantially higher as some of them depart almost immediately <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Since the rest of the derivations in the paper rely on (1), it is important to verify that asymptotic approximations from renewal process theory actually hold in practice. We created a hypothetical system with n = 1000 users and degree k = 10, in which each node lived for a random duration Li and then departed from the system. To prevent the network size from depleting to zero, each failed node was immediately replaced by a fresh node with another random lifetime L j (the exact arrival process was not essential and had no effect on the results). For each new arrival v into the system, we recorded the residual lifetimes of the neighbors that v randomly selected from the pool of n − 1 online peers.</p><p>Results of two typical simulations are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3</ref> for the exponential and Pareto lifetimes. As we often do throughout the paper, parameters α and λ are selected so that E[L i ] is 0.5 hours for both distributions and the scaling parameter β is set to 1 in the Pareto F (x).

Further notice in the figure that the exponential Ri are limited by 4 hours, while the Pareto Ri stretch to as high as 61 hours. While it is clear that node arrival instants t v are uncorrelated with lifespans [a i , d i ] of other nodes, the same observation holds for random points τ i at which the i-th neighbor of v fails. We extensively experimented with the active model, in which additional node selection occurred at instants τi, and found that all R i obtained in this process also followed (1) very well (not shown for brevity).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Resilience Analysis</head><p>Throughout the paper, we study resilience of P2P systems using two main metrics -the time before all neighbors of v are simultaneously in the failed state and the probability of this occurring before v decides to leave the system. We call the former metric isolation time T and the latter probability of isolation π. Recall that the passive model follows a simple pure-death degree evolution process illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a). In this environment, a node is considered isolated after its last surviving neighbor fails. Thus, T is equal to the maximum residual lifetime among all neighbors and its expectation can be written as (using the fact that T is a non-negative random variable) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E[T ] = ∞ 0 1 − 1 E[L i ] k x 0 (1 − F (z))dz k dx, (3)</formula><p>which leads to the following two results after straightforward integration.</p><p>Theorem 1. Assume a passive k-regular graph. Then, for exponential lifetimes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E[T ] = 1 λ k i=1 k i (−1) i+1 i (4)</formula><p>and for Pareto lifetimes with α &gt; 2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E[T ] = −β 1 + Γ 1 1−α k!

As the figure shows, simulation results for both exponential and Pareto distributions match the corresponding model very well. We also observe that for the same degree and average lifetime, Pareto nodes exhibit longer average times to isolation. For k = 10, E[T ] is 1.46 hours given exponential lifetimes and 4.68 hours given Pareto lifetimes. This difference was expected since T is determined by the residual lives of the neighbors, who in the Pareto case have large Ri and stay online longer than newly arriving peers. We next focus on the probability that isolation occurs within the lifespan of a given user. Consider a node v with lifetime L v . This node is forced to disconnect from the system only if Lv is greater than T , which happens with <ref type="bibr">and f (x)</ref> is the PDF of user lifetimes. This leads to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">probability π = P (T &lt; Lv) = ∞ 0 FT (x)f (x)dx, where FT (x) = FR(x) k is the CDF of time T</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">π = 1 E[L i ] k ∞ 0 x 0 (1 − F (z))dz k f (x)dx.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Next, we study two distributions F (x) and demonstrate the effect of tail-weight on the local resilience of the system.</p><p>Theorem 2. Assume a passive k-regular graph. Then, for exponential lifetimes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">π = 1 k + 1 (7)</formula><p>and for Pareto lifetimes with α &gt; 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">π = Γ 1 + α α−1 k!

Hence, when a new node v joins a P2P system with exponentially distributed lifetimes Li, it will be forced to disconnect if and only if it can outlive k other random nodes that started at the same time t v . From Lemma 1, we already know that this happens with probability 1/(k + 1).</p><p>The accuracy of <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(8)</ref> is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>(b), which plots π obtained in simulations together with that predicted by the models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion</head><p>Notice from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>(b) that the Pareto π decays quicker and always stays lower than the exponential π. To better understand the effect of α on the isolation probability in the rather cryptic expression <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(8)</ref>, we first show that for all choices of α, Pareto systems are more resilient than exponential. We then show that as α → ∞, (8) approaches from below its upper bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Setting c = Γ(1+ α α−1</formula><p>), re-write (8) expanding the gamma function in the denominator:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">π = ck! k + α α−1 ! ≈ c k + 1 + 1 2(α − 1) −α/(α−1)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>and notice that (9) always provides a faster decay to zero as a function of k than (7). For the Pareto example of α = 3 shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>(b), π follows the curve (k + 1.25) −1.5 , which decays faster than the exponential model by a factor of √ k. This difference is even more pronounced for distributions with heavier tails. For example, (8) tends to zero as (k + 1.5) −2 for α = 2 and as (k + 6) −11 for α = 1.1. The effect of tail-weight on isolation dynamics is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref> where small values of α indeed provide large E <ref type="bibr">[T ]</ref> and small π. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>(b) also demonstrates that as shape α becomes large, the Pareto distribution no longer exhibits its "heavy-tailed" advantages and is essentially reduced to the exponential model. This can also be seen in (9), which tends to 1/(k + 1) for α → ∞.</p><p>Given the above discussion, it becomes apparent that it is possible to make π arbitrarily small with very heavytailed distributions (e.g., α = 1.05 and k = 20 produce π = 3.7 × 10 −12 ). While these results may be generally encouraging for networks of non-human devices with controllable characteristics, most current peer-to-peer systems are not likely to be satisfied with the performance of the passive model since selection of α is not possible in the design of a typical P2P network and isolation probabilities in (8) are unacceptably high for α &gt; 1.5. The second problem with the passive framework is that its application to real systems requires accurate knowledge of the shape parameter α, which may not be available in practice.</p><p>We overcome both problems in the next two section, where we show that active node replacement significantly increases resilience and that all Pareto distributions have a reasonably tight upper bound on π that does not depend on α.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ACTIVE LIFETIME MODEL: STATIONARY ANALYSIS</head><p>To reduce the rate of isolation and repair broken routes in P2P networks, previous studies have suggested distributed recovery algorithms in which failed neighbors are dynamically replaced with nodes that are still alive. In this section, we offer a model for this strategy, derive the expected value of T using stationary techniques in renewal process theory, and analyze performance gains of this framework compared to the passive case. In the next section, we apply the theory of rare events for mixing processes to W (t) and derive a reasonably good upper bound on π.</p><p>It is natural to assume that node failure in P2P networks can be detected through some keep-alive mechanism, which includes periodic probing of each neighbor, retransmission of lost messages, and timeout-based decisions to search for a replacement. We do not dwell on the details of this framework and assume that each peer v is capable of detecting neighbor failure through some transport-layer protocol. The second step after node failure is detected is to repair the "failed" zone of the DHT and restructure certain links to maintain consistency and efficiency of routing (non-DHT systems may utilize a variety of random neighbor-replacement strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>). We are not concerned with the details of this step either and generically combine both failure detection and repair into a random variable called S i , which is the total "search" time for the i-th replacement in the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Preliminaries</head><p>In the active model, each neighbor i (1 ≤ i ≤ k) of node v is either alive at any time t or its replacement is being sought from among the remaining nodes in the graph. Thus, neighbor i can be considered in the on state at time t if it is alive or in the off state otherwise. This neighbor failure/replacement procedure can be modeled as an on/off process Y i (t):</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Yi(t) = 1 neighbor i alive at t 0 otherwise .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>This framework is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, which shows the evolution of k neighbor processes Y 1 (t), . . . , Y k (t). Using this notation, the degree of node v at time t is equal to</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">W (t) = k i=1 Y i (t)</formula><p>. Similar to our definition in Section 2.1, a node is isolated at such time T when all of its neighbors are simultaneously in the off state (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(b)</ref>). Thus, the maximum time a node can spend in the system before it is forced to disconnect can be formalized as the first hitting time of process W (t) on level 0:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">T = inf(t &gt; 0 : W (t) = 0|W (0) = k).<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Notice that under proper selection of the tail-weight of the lifetime distribution (i.e., the length of on periods), W (t) becomes a super-position of heavy-tailed on/off processes and may exhibit self-similarity for sufficiently large k <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Due to limited space, we omit log-log variance plots that confirm this effect, but note that to our knowledge, the fact that node degree in P2P networks may become selfsimilar has not been documented before.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Expected Time to Isolation</head><p>In what follows in the rest of this section, we apply the theory of regenerative processes to W (t) and derive a closedform expression for E <ref type="bibr">[T ]</ref>. We start with a simple lemma.</p><p>Lemma 3. The steady-state probability of finding a neighbor in the on state is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">p = lim t→∞ P (Y i (t) = 1) = E[R i ] E[S i ] + E[R i ] ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where E[S i ] is the mean node-replacement delay and E[R i ] is the expected residual lifetime.</p><p>This result immediately leads to the probability of finding stationary process W (t) in any of its k + 1 states. Corollary 1. The steady-state distribution of W (t) is binomial with parameters k and p:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">lim t→∞ P (W (t) = m) = k m p m (1 − p) k−m .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Both (12)-(13) match simulation results very well (not shown for brevity) and do not depend on the distribution of search delays or user lifetimes. Next, notice that it is convenient to also view W (t) as an alternating on/off process, where each on period corresponds to W (t) &gt; 0 and each off period to W (t) = 0. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>, where Uj is the duration of the j-th off cycle and Tj is the length of the j-th on cycle. Then we have the following result.</p><p>Theorem 3. Assuming asymptotically small search delays with E[S i ] E[R i ], the expected time a node can stay in the system before isolation is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">E [T ] ≈ E [S i ] k 1 + E [R i ] E [Si] k − 1 ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where E[S i ] is the mean search time and E[R i ] is the expected residual lifetime.</p><p>Proof. Our goal is to determine the expected duration of the first cycle (i.e., E[T 1 ]) shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>. The proof consists of two parts: we first argue that the length of cycle T1 is similar to that of the remaining cycles Tj, j ≥ 2, and then apply Smith's theorem to</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">W (t) to derive E[T j ], j ≥ 2.</formula><p>First, notice that cycle T 1 is different from the other on periods since it always starts from W (t) = k, while the other on cycles start from W (t) = 1. However, since we already assumed that the search times are sufficiently small, W (t) at the beginning of each on period almost immediately "shoots back" to W (t) = k. This can be shown using arguments from large-deviations theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, which derives bounds on the return time of the system from very rare states back to its "most likely" state. This generally makes cycles T1 and T j (j ≥ 2) different by a value that is negligible compared to E <ref type="bibr">[T ]</ref> in real-life situations (see examples after the proof).</p><p>We next derive the expected length of T j , j ≥ 2.

As before, suppose that the first instant of the j-th off cycle of W (t) starts at time τj. At this time, there are k − 1 already-failed neighbors still "searching" for their replacement and one neighbor that just failed at time τ j . Thus, U j is the minimum time needed to find a replacement for the last neighbor or for one of the on-going searches to complete.</p><p>More formally, suppose that V1, . . . , V k−1 represent the remaining replacement delays of the k − 1 already-failed neighbors and S k is the replacement time of the last neighbor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Then duration U j of the current off cycle is U j = min{V1, . . . , V k−1 , S k }.

In each part (a)-(d) of the figure, the two curves correspond to exponential and Pareto lifetimes with mean 30 minutes (as before, the models are plotted as solid lines and simulations are drawn using isolated points). Notice in all four subfigures that the model tracks simulation results for over 7 orders of magnitude and that the expected isolation time is in fact not sensitive to the distribution of Si.</p><p>As in the passive model, the exponential distribution of lifetimes provides a lower bound on the performance of any Pareto system (since exponential E[R i ] is always smaller than the corresponding Pareto E <ref type="bibr">[Ri]</ref>). Further observe that the main factor that determines E[T ] is the ratio of E <ref type="bibr">[Ri]</ref> to E[S i ] and not their individual values. Using this insight and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>, we can conclude that in systems with 10 neighbors and expected search delay at least 5 times smaller than the mean lifetime, E[T ] is at least one million times larger than the mean session length of an average user. Furthermore, this result holds for exponential as well as Pareto distributions with arbitrary α. This is a significant improvement over the results of the passive model in Section 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Chord Example</head><p>We now phrase the above framework in more practical terms and study the resilience of Chord as a function of node degree k. For the sake of this example, suppose that each node relies on a keep-alive protocol with timeout δ. Then, the distribution of failure-detection delays is uniform in <ref type="bibr">[0, δ]</ref>   a replacement may be determined by the average number of application-layer hops between each pair of users and the average Internet delay d between the overlay nodes in the system.

Assuming that δ is the keep-alive timeout and d is the average Internet delay between the P2P nodes, the expected isolation time in Chord is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">E [T ] = δ + d log 2 n 2k 1 + 2E [R i ] δ + d log 2 n k .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Consider a Chord system with the average inter-peer delay d = 200 ms, n = 1 million nodes (average distance 10 hops), and E[Ri] = 1 hour. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> shows the expected time to isolation for several values of timeout δ and degree k.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Real P2P Networks</head><p>Finally, we address the practicality of the examples shown in the paper so far. It may appear that E[Ri] = 1 hour is rather large for current P2P systems since common experience suggests that many users leave within several minutes of their arrival into the system. This is consistent with our Pareto model in which the majority of users have very small online lifetimes, while a handful of users that stay connected for weeks contribute to the long tails of the distribution. For Pareto lifetimes with α = 3 and E[R i ] = 1 hour, the mean  online stay is only 30 minutes and 25% of the users depart within 6 minutes of their arrival. In fact, this rate of turnaround is quite aggressive and exceeds that observed in real P2P systems by a factor of two <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. We should also address the results shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which suggest that the empirical distribution of user lifetimes in real P2P networks follows a Pareto distribution with shape parameter α = 1.06. Such heavy-tailed distributions result in E[R i ] = E[T ] = ∞ and do not lead to much interesting discussion. At the same time, notice that while it is hypothetically possible to construct a P2P system with α = 1.06, it can also be argued that the measurement study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> sampled the residuals rather than the actual lifetimes of the users. This is a consequence of the "snapshots" taken every 20 minutes, which missed all peers with Li &lt; 20 minutes and shortened the lifespans of the remaining users by random amounts of time. As such, these results point toward α = 2.06, which is a much more realistic shape parameter even though it still produces enormous E[T ] for all feasible values of E <ref type="bibr">[Si]</ref>. This is demonstrated for Chord's model <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref> in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> where the expected lifetime of each user is only double that in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>, but E[T ] is 5-12 orders of magnitude larger. This is a result of E[R i ] rising from 1 hour in the former case to 16.6 hours in the latter scenario.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Heavy-Tailed Lifetimes</head><p>Although it would be nice to obtain a similar result π ≈ E[L i ]/E <ref type="bibr">[T ]</ref> for the Pareto case, unfortunately the situation with a superposition of heavy-tailed on/off processes is different since W (t) is slowly mixing and the same bounds no longer apply. Intuitively, it is clear that large values of E <ref type="bibr">[T ]</ref> in the Pareto case are caused by a handful of users with enormous isolation delays, while the majority of remaining peers acquire neighbors with short lifetimes and suffer isolation almost as quickly as in the exponential case. Consider an example that illustrates this effect and shows that huge values of E <ref type="bibr">[T ]</ref> in Pareto systems have little impact on π. For 10 neighbors, α = 3 and λ = 2 (E[Li] = 30 minutes), and constant search time s = 6 minutes, the Pareto E[T ] is larger than the exponential E[T ] by a factor of 865. However, the ratio of their isolation probabilities is only 5.7. For α = 2.5 and λ = 1.5 (E[L i ] = 40 minutes), the expected times to isolation differ by a factor of 8.1 × 10 5 , but the ratio of their π is only 7.5.</p><p>It may be possible to derive an accurate approximation for Pareto π; however, one may also argue that the useful-  ness of such a result is limited given that shape parameter α and the distribution of user lifetimes (lognormal, Pareto, etc.) are often not known accurately. We leave the exploration of this problem for future work and instead utilize the exponential metric (23) as an upper bound on π in systems with sufficiently heavy-tailed lifetime distributions. The result below follows from the fact that heavy-tailed L i imply stochastically larger residual lifetimes R i and a straightforward expansion of E[T ] in (23).</p><p>Corollary 3. For an arbitrary distribution of search delays and any lifetime distribution F (x) with an exponential or heavier tail, which includes Pareto, lognormal, Weibull, and Cauchy distributions, the following upper bound holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">π ≤ kE[Li]E[Si] k−1 (E[L i ] + E[S i ]) k − E[S i ] k ≈ kE[Li]E[Si] k−1 (E[L i ] + E[S i ]) k . (29)</formula><p>For example, using 30-minute average lifetimes, 9 neighbors per node, and 1-minute average node replacement delay, the upper bound in (29) equals 1.02 × 10 −11 , which allows the joining users in a 100-billion node network to stay connected to the graph for their entire lifespans with probability 1 − 1/n. Using the uniform failure model of prior work and p = 1/2, each user required 37 neighbors to achieve the same π regardless of the actual dynamics of the system.</p><p>Even though exponential π is often several times larger than the Pareto π (the exact ratio depends on shape α), it turns out that the difference in node degree needed to achieve a certain level of resilience is usually negligible. To illustrate this result, <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> shows the minimum degree k that ensures a given π for different values of search time E[S i ] and Pareto lifetimes with α = 2.06 (to maintain the mean lifetime 30 minutes, the distribution is scaled using β = 0.53). The column "uniform p = 1/2" contains degree k that can be deduced from the p-percent failure model (for p = 1/2) discussed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.

Assuming that lifetimes are independent of node degree and are not used in the neighbor-selection process, regular graphs are the most resilient for a given average degree</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">E[k i ].</formula><p>To demonstrate the effect of node degree on isolation probability in irregular graphs, we examine three systems with 1000 nodes: 1) Chord with a random distribution of outdegree, which is a consequence of imbalance in zone sizes; 2) a G(n, p) graph with binomial degree for p = 0.5; and 3) a heavy-tailed graph with Pareto degree for α = 2.5 and β = 15. We selected these parameters so that each of the graphs had a mean degree E[k i ] equal to 10. The distribution of degree in these graphs is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>(a). Notice that Chord has the lowest variance and its probability mass concentration around the mean is the best of the three systems. The binomial case is slightly worse, while the heavy-tailed graph is the worst. According to Theorem 5, all of these systems should have larger isolation probabilities than those of 10-regular graphs and should exhibit performance inverse proportional to the variance of their degree.</p><p>Simulation results of π are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>(b) for Pareto lifetimes with α = 3 and E[L i ] = 0.5 hours (search times are constant). Observe in the figure that the k-regular system is in fact better than the irregular graphs and that the performance of the latter deteriorates as V ar <ref type="bibr">[ki]</ref> increases. For s = 0.1 (6 minutes), the k-regular graph offers π lower than Chord's by a factor of 10 and lower than that in G(n, p) by a factor of 190. Furthermore, the heavy-tailed P2P system in the figure exhibits the same poor performance regardless of the search time s and allows users to become isolated 10 2 − 10 6 times more frequently than in the optimal case, all of which is caused by 37% of the users having degree 3 or less.</p><p>Thus, in cases when degree is independent of user lifetimes, we find no evidence to suggest that unstructured P2P systems with a heavy-tailed (or otherwise irregular) degree can provide better resilience than k-regular DHTs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">GLOBAL RESILIENCE</head><p>We finish the paper by analyzing the probability of network partitioning under uniform node failure and showing that this metric has a simple expression for a certain family of graphs, which includes many proposed P2P networks. We then apply this insight to lifetime-based systems and utilize the earlier derived metric π to characterize the evolution of P2P networks under churn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Classical Result</head><p>One may wonder how local resilience (i.e., absence of isolated vertices) of P2P graphs translates into their global resilience (i.e., connectivity of the entire network). While this topic has not received much attention in the P2P community, it has been extensively researched in random graph theory and interconnection networks. Existing results for classical random graphs have roots in the work of Erdös and Rényi in the 1960s and demonstrate that almost every (i.e., with probability 1 − o(1) as n → ∞) random graph including G(n, p), G(n, M ), and G(n, k out ) is connected if and only if it has no isolated vertices <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">P (G is connected) = P (X = 0) as n → ∞,<label>(30)</label></formula><p>where X is the number of isolated nodes after the failure. After some manipulation, this result can be translated to apply to unstructured P2P networks, where each joining user draws some number of random out-degree neighbors from among the existing nodes (see below for simulations that confirm this). For deterministic networks, connectivity of a graph G after node/edge failure has also received a fair amount of attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). In interconnection networks, exact formulas for the connectivity of deterministic graphs exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>; however, they require computation of NP-complete metrics and no closed-form solution is available even for the basic hypercube. However, from the perspective of random graph theory, it has been shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> that hypercubes with faulty elements asymptotically behave as random graphs and thus almost surely disconnect with isolated nodes as n becomes large.</p><p>Even though the necessary condition for a deterministic G to satisfy (30) is unknown at this time, sufficient conditions can be extrapolated from the proofs of this relationship for the hypercube <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The general requirement on G is that its  expansion (strength of the various cuts) must be no worse than that of the hypercube. 3 Due to limited space and wide variety of deterministic P2P constructs, we do not provide a rigorous re-derivation of this fact, but instead note that Chord <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Pastry <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and CAN with the number of dimensions d = Θ(log n) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> can be directly reduced to hypercubes; de Bruijn graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> exhibit better connectivity than hypercubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>; and hybrid networks (such as Symphony <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, Randomized Chord <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) generally have connectivity no worse than G(n, k out ). We next show simulation results that confirm the application of classical result (30) to two types of DHTs and one unstructured Gnutella-like network (all three are directed graphs). <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref> shows simulations of Chord, Symphony, and a k-regular Gnutella network under uniform p-percent node failure using 100, 000 failure patterns. Note that for directed graphs, (30) applies only to the definition of weak connectivity, which means that G is disconnected if and only if its undirected version G is and a node v ∈ G is isolated if and only if it is isolated in G . Since the total degree (which is the sum of out-degree and in-degree) at each node is different between the graphs in the table, their respective disconnection probabilities are different.</p><p>As the table shows, (30) holds with high accuracy and a vast majority of disconnections contain at least one isolated node (the last column of the table). Additional simulations show that (30) applies to Pastry, CAN, de Bruijn graphs, Randomized Chord, and degree-irregular Gnutella. We omit these results for brevity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Lifetime-Based Extension</head><p>It is not difficult to see that (30) holds for lifetime-based P2P graphs and that dynamic P2P networks are also much more likely to develop disconnections around single nodes rather than along boundaries of larger sets S. However, instead of having a single node-failure metric p, we have a probability of isolation π associated with each joining user i. Thus, one may ask a question what is the probability that the system survives N user joins and stays connected the entire time? The answer is very simple: assuming Y is a geometric random variable measuring the number of user joins before the first disconnection of the network, we have for almost every sufficiently large graph:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">P (Y &gt; N ) = (1 − π) N .<label>(31)</label></formula><p>Simulation results of (31) are shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> using N = 1 million joins and 10, 000 iterations per search time, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> For each set S in the original graph G, its node boundary must satisfy a certain inequality that is an increasing function of |S| <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Graphs that do not fulfill this requirement include trees, cycles, and other weakly connected structures.    where metric q(G) = P (X &gt; 0|G is disconnected) is the probability that the graph partitions with at least one isolated node and r(G) is the probability that the largest connected component after the disconnection contains exactly n − 1 nodes. As the table shows, simulations match the model very well and also confirm that the most likely disconnection pattern of lifetime-based systems includes at least one isolated node (i.e., q(G) = 1). In fact, the table shows an even stronger result -for reasonably small search delays, network partitioning almost surely affects only one node in the system (i.e., r(G) = 1). The same conclusion holds for other P2P graphs, Pareto lifetimes, and random search delays. We omit these results for brevity. <ref type="bibr">Model (31)</ref> suggests that when search delays become very small, the system may evolve for many months or years before disconnection. Consider a 12-regular CAN system with 1-minute search delays and 30-minute average lifetimes. Assuming that n = 10 6 and each user diligently joins the system once per day, the probability that the network can evolve for 2, 700 years (N = 10 13 joins) before disconnecting for the first time is 0.9956. The mean delay before the first disconnection is E[Y ] = 1/π user joins, or 5.9 million years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">FUTURE WORK</head><p>The discussion at the end of Section 5 suggests that irregular graphs cannot be beneficial, unless node degree is correlated with user lifetimes. Notice that users v who stay online longer have a larger probability of disconnection π = P (T &lt; L v ) ≈ L v /E <ref type="bibr">[T ]</ref> (see the proof of Theorem 4). Thus, to achieve resilience higher than that of k-regular graphs, one must assign smaller degree to nodes that have smaller lifetimes, and vice versa. To better understand this concept, which we call Dynamic Degree Scaling (DDS), notice that peers with very small L i do not require 20 neighbors to stay connected for their entire lifespans. In fact, these nodes often leave even before their first neighbor fails. As the age of a peer increases, it becomes more likely to outlive its original neighbors and suffer an isolation, which clearly warrants an increase in its degree over time. In future work, we plan to understand how DDS allows unstructured P2P systems to evolve into graphs where users that stay online longer are responsible for larger parts of the graph and examine whether these evolution models can be implemented in practice and/or combined with other methods, in which degree depends on unequal peer characteristics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>).</p><p>Finally, note that while DDS allows degree k i to depend on users' lifetime L i , the actual links between the nodes can be formed randomly and without the knowledge of the other peers' lifetimes or their current age. An alternative strategy is to allow each node to prefer connections to peers that have the largest age metric at current time t <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which requires a different model and possibly has its own optimal strategy. We plan to investigate this direction in future work as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper examined two aspects of resilience in dynamic P2P systems -ability of each user to stay connected to the system in the presence of frequent node departure and partitioning behavior of the network as n → ∞. We found that under all practical search times, k-regular graphs were much more resilient than traditionally implied <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and further showed that dynamic P2P networks could almost surely remain connected as long as no user suffered simultaneous neighbor failure. We also demonstrated that varying node degree from peer to peer can have a positive impact on resilience only when such decisions are correlated with the users' lifetimes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Degree evolution process leading to isolation under (a) passive and (b) active models.</figDesc></figure>
