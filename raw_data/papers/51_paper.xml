				<p>Distance estimation and topological proximity in the Internet have recently emerged as important problems for many distributed applications [1], [10], [11], [19], [29], [31], [40], [41], [44]. Besides deploying tracers and using virtual coordinates, distance is often estimated using end-to-end methods such as King [13] that rely on the existing DNS infrastructure. However, the question of accuracy in such end-to-end estimation and its ability to produce a large-scale map of Internet delays has never been examined. We undertake this task below and show that King suffers from non-negligible error when DNS zones employ geographically diverse authoritative servers or utilize forwarders, both of which are very common in the existing Internet. We also show that King requires insertion of numerous unwanted DNS records in caches of remote servers (which is called cache pollution) and requires large traffic overhead when deployed in large-scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework we call Turbo King (T-King) that obtains end-to-end delay samples without bias in the presence of distant authoritative servers and forwarders, while consuming half the bandwidth needed by King and reducing the impact of cache pollution by several orders of magnitude. We finish the paper by evaluating Turbo King in several experiments.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Widespread interest in distance estimation in the Internet has recently evolved into a large field <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. The purpose of this research is to estimate or measure the latency between hosts, which can then be leveraged to provide better service to end-users and construct more efficient networks. Examples include increasing the responsiveness of online games, efficiently locating the closest server in a content distribution network, and building topologically-aware P2P networks. While the existing approaches are promising, obtaining a large-scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Internet distance map for verification of virtual-coordinate approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and actual use in deployed applications has proven to be a difficult task. The aim of this paper is to introduce a first step in this direction * Supported by NSF grants CCR-0306246, ANI-0312461, CNS-0434940, CNS-0519442, and CNS-0720571. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The scale considered in this paper assumes building an all-to-all delay matrix between approximately 220, 000 BGP prefixes advertised in the Internet. This is in contrast to the frequently-used latency maps today <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> that rely on 100 − 400 nodes in PlanetLab or 1700 − 2500 nodes in the DNS tree. and propose a framework that allows such a service to be transparently enabled in the current Internet.</p><p>Due to the difficulty of deploying tracers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> in every possible network, we choose to build upon an existing technique called King <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> that does not require any changes to existing protocols or access to remote computers. King approximates the distance between end-hosts using the delay between DNS servers authoritative for IP addresses of the hosts in question. While generally accepted as a sound methodology for estimating delay and used in many papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, King has not been analyzed for accuracy and pitfalls since the original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, nor has it been involved in measurements larger than 2500×2500 nodes. Furthermore, some of the advanced techniques suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> have never been implemented and their feasibility in practice has not been assessed in the literature.</p><p>We start the paper by identifying causes of King's inaccuracy and evaluating its suitability for large-scale measurements. We first argue that King incorrectly estimates delay when the target DNS zone contains multiple nameservers that are not geographically close to each other (e.g., outside the target domain and its BGP network). We also find that King can estimate entirely wrong delays when the source DNS zone uses forwarders, which are stand-alone servers that aggregate queries from multiple domains. In such cases, King fails to detect the presence and location of forwarders, in addition to incorrectly measuring the forwarder's query-processing delay that must be subtracted from the final measurement. In regard to overhead, King utilizes a complex multi-step process (see below for the algorithm) that requires numerous queries for each delay measurement and seeding of source DNS servers with a large number of unwanted entries. As the scale of the experiment increases, cache pollution becomes a non-trivial issue.</p><p>To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new system called Turbo King (T-King) that streamlines the process of making distance measurements using DNS, improves their accuracy, reduces overhead, and almost entirely eliminates cache pollution. The first component of T-King is a large collection of nameservers distributed throughout the Internet, from which the closest nameserver to each end-host A is selected for use in the measurement. In the current implementation, we use periodic crawls of the DNS tree to find nameservers that can be used in the measurement and maintain this information in our server. The second component of T-King is a new measurement algorithm based on several improvements we have made to the advanced techniques in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> that mitigate problems caused by forwarders and zones with multiple authoritative nameservers. Our approach not only reduces the number of queries and bandwidth overhead of King by more than 50%, but also achieves higher accuracy and a factor of N reduction in the number of polluted cache entries at each remote server for an N × N latency measurement.</p><p>We finish the paper by showing how to build the current database of DNS servers in Turbo King, examining how likely King is to experience its drawbacks in practice, and assessing the effect of these drawbacks on King's delay estimation. We first perform a reverse DNS crawl to discover a set of 216, 843 nameservers, out of which we find 117, 817 to be recursive and accepting queries from outside networks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> These servers reside in 174 countries, cover over 31, 000 BGP prefixes, and are responsible for approximately 50% of IP addresses (i.e., 828 million) advertised in BGP <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Further analyzing the data, we find that 33% of reverse DNS zones utilize a nameserver that neither belongs to the same BGP prefix nor the same domain as the other servers. Additionally, over 32% of recursive servers found in this study use a hidden forwarder, which suggests that a large fraction of King's measurements may be affected by the drawbacks identified in this work. We finish the paper by quantifying the effect of this bias using a small 50 × 50 delay matrix and comparing the estimates of King to those of Turbo King. Our results show that 15% of the measurements are different by more than 10% and 8% by more than 20%, which suggests that the magnitude of bias in King is generally mild, but nevertheless non-negligible.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II studies previous work. Sections III and IV outline issues with King. Section V introduces T-King and Section VI evaluates our method, comparing it to King. Section VII concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BACKGROUND</head><p>The Domain Name System (DNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> is a distributed tree-based database that allows for the resolution of domain names to various types of data, most notably IP addresses. The DNS standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> also provides for reverse lookup of IP addresses, which is accomplished through the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain tree. There are several types of servers and clients that operate on DNS and to avoid confusion we introduce the following terminology. In this paper, a recursive resolver is a server that queries the DNS and returns answers to endhosts. Nameservers are DNS servers that maintain authoritative data about a subset (i.e., zone) of the domain space. Recursive nameservers act as both a recursive resolver and a nameserver <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Other techniques (such as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>) can significantly expand this database. It is believed that there are between 580, 000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and 975, 000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> open recursive DNS servers in the Internet. simultaneously. An open resolver is either a recursive nameserver or a recursive resolver that responds to recursive queries for arbitrary zones from hosts outside its local network.</p><p>King <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> uses existing DNS infrastructure to measure the latency between two hosts on the Internet. The method relies on the fact that open recursive nameservers on the Internet will attempt to resolve any valid request, which forces them to query remote nameservers for the proper response. The time that these queries take to be processed can be measured to determine the distance between the two nameservers. In order for the measurements to apply to arbitrary hosts, Gummadi et al. assume that end-hosts on the Internet are within close proximity to the authoritative DNS nameserver that maintains DNS information about their IP address. Given this assumption, King approximates the delay between hosts A and B using the latency between their authoritative servers X and Y as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. Heuristics are used to choose which authoritative nameserver to include in the measurements, the details of which can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. UNDERSTANDING ORIGINAL KING</head><p>We refer to the main technique proposed by <ref type="bibr">Gummadi et al. in [13]</ref> as Original King (O-King). O-King has been used extensively in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> as a way to easily collect latency information from the Internet; however, no formal or detailed analysis of its pitfalls exists to date. We first describe the measurement algorithm used by O-King, which is necessary for understanding its limitations and our proposed system later in the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Measurement Algorithm</head><p>We start by defining terminology. Throughout the rest of the paper, a query is defined as a single DNS request sent to a remote server and an answer is the response to a query. Queries are either recursive or iterative as defined by the DNS specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Given time t s when a query is sent and t r when the answer is received for that query, we define a sample s to be t r − t s . We are now ready to detail the O-King algorithm that measures delay between two nameservers.</p><p>The O-King process is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, where ns.example.com is a recursive nameserver chosen by OKing as "close" to the desired IP. In the figure, each query is labeled as either RQ for recursive query or IQ for iterative query. Answers are labeled with A. A seed recursive query, which is represented by message numbers 1-4, is sent to </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Zones with Multiple Authoritative Nameservers</head><p>In the original specification for DNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, it is recommended that authoritative nameservers be placed in geographically diverse locations on separate networks. Thus, if connectivity is interrupted at one of the sites, the remaining nameservers would maintain availability for the zone. Queries for a particular zone are sent to one address in the group of nameservers, but the decision about which nameserver to query is left up to the individual resolver implementation. As O-King requires at least four <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> samples to converge to an accurate measurement, different nameservers are potentially used for each sample. While this is of little consequence if all nameservers for a zone are on the same network, in cases where the DNS specification is strictly followed the samples could be very different, leading to inaccuracy in the final latency estimation. This issue is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>(a) for three samples taken by the O-King client, where the authoritative nameservers for the target.com zone are ns1.target.com, ns2.target.com, and ns1.alt.us.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. DNS Forwarders</head><p>Another potential issue for O-King measurements is the use of forwarders on the Internet by system administrators. A forwarder serves as an aggregation point for DNS queries initiated from within a network that target external destinations. If a recursive nameserver that is configured to forward messages receives a recursive query for a zone it has no authority over, it sends the query to the forwarder without notifying the end-user. The forwarder then resolves the query instead of the recursive nameserver. This process is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3(b)</ref>, where direct contact is intended between ns.example.com and ns1.target.com, but the query is routed through the forwarder instead. The presence of forwarders is undetectable by O-King and compromises the assumption that there is direct contact between ns.example.com and ns1.target.com, leading to an invalid latency estimate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Cache Pollution</head><p>The final concern that arises from the use of O-King is the impact it has on the nameservers used for latency estimates. While the purpose of an authoritative DNS nameserver is to provide accurate information about the data under its control to the global Internet, the purpose of a DNS cache is to reduce latency strictly for local users, those end-hosts that principally rely on the nameserver to resolve queries on their behalf. Given that DNS caches are intended to benefit these users, we define cache pollution to be the insertion of DNS zone data that has not been requested by a local user into the cache of a nameserver.</p><p>O-King uses a seed query to force the recursive nameserver to cache the NS (nameserver) and A (IP address) records of all target authoritative nameservers. While this is unlikely to cause performance problems on a small scale, initiating billions of O-King queries could lead to a large proportion of the cache containing information that was not requested by local users. Furthermore, local administrators are unlikely to view this intrusion as benign and may take preventative steps, jeopardizing future measurements using O-King.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. UNDERSTANDING DIRECT KING</head><p>We refer to the second technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> as Direct King (D-King), which involves a modification of the OKing measurement algorithm that allows for specification of a single nameserver from the target zone. While not mentioned explicitly in the original paper, all other aspects of D-King (i.e., nameserver selection, end-to-end estimation assumptions) we assume to be equivalent to O-King. To our knowledge, only <ref type="bibr">Ballani et al. [3]</ref> have partially implemented D-King, which was required for their study of IP Anycast as deployed by DNS root servers. There was no study or analysis of D-King in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. We start by describing the D-King algorithm and later discuss some of its drawbacks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D-King</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Measurement Algorithm</head><p>The D-King latency estimation process is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  4</ref>, where ns.example.com is again a recursive nameserver. In contrast to O-King, where the query is sent to one or more nameservers responsible for the target.com domain, DKing allows the user to pick a single authoritative nameserver, which in this case is ns1.target.com. To accomplish this, D-King requires that a domain name be registered and a nameserver set up to resolve queries for said domain. In the figure, king.com is the example domain and ns.king.com is its authoritative nameserver. D-King first requires a seed query to guarantee direct contact between ns.example.com and ns1.target.com, which is illustrated in the figure by messages 1-4. To do this, D-King initiates a recursive query to ns.example.com for 10-0-0-1.king.com, which encodes the IP address of ns1.target.com into the query. As ns.king.com is authoritative for the king.com domain, it receives the query and uses the encoded address to respond that ns1.target.com is authoritative for the query, which is then cached at ns.example.com. By doing so, ns.example.com will now automatically forward queries for 10-0-0-1.king.com directly to ns1.target.com. Once the cache is seeded, the actual latency measurements can be taken. Local sample L i , represented as messages 5 and 6 in the figure, is taken in the same fashion as O-King. Remote sample R i , illustrated by messages 7-10, is recorded by sending queries for random subdomains of 10-0-0-1.king.com to ns.example.com, which directly queries ns1.target.com as a result. Since ns1.target.com is not actually authoritative for the zone, it responds with an error indication, which is then echoed back to the D-King client. The final latency estimate produced by D-King is calculated in the same manner as that in O-King.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Additional Complexity</head><p>While D-King indeed eliminates the issue of zones with multiple authoritative nameservers affecting the latency estimate, the cost of this improvement is that the D-King client must explicitly specify the target nameserver, which is not required by O-King. It is not mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> exactly how this should be accomplished, but the same heuristic approach for discovering a close recursive nameserver applies in this case as well. Furthermore, a domain must be registered and a nameserver set up to respond to queries in the way D-King requires. One of the major benefits of O-King is that latency estimates can be obtained from any machine with an Internet connection, whereas D-King requires this extra infrastructure. The individual must decide whether the additional complexity is worth the improved accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. DNS Forwarders</head><p>Along with O-King, the use of forwarders on the Internet affects D-King latency estimates as well. The D-King client and authoritative nameserver for the measurement (e.g., ns.king.com in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3(b)</ref>) are separate entities that only communicate through the query encoded with the IP address of the target nameserver. It is inconsequential to ns.king.com that a different nameserver (i.e., the forwarder) than the one intended by the D-King client sends it the query and caches the response. Because of this lack of communication between the components of the D-King latency estimates, forwarders remain undetected and affect the results in the same manner as discussed in the O-King case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Cache Pollution</head><p>The seed query required by D-King plants authoritative data for the registered domain (e.g., king.com) at the recursive nameserver in a similar fashion to that required by O-King. However, there are differences in the impact on local DNS caches. The O-King seed query forces the caching of data for all authoritative nameservers of the target zone, whereas D-King caches data for a single nameserver. In contrast to OKing, where the cached entries might have some future use to the local users, the D-King entry is only useful to the latency estimate. At the scale of billions of queries, if D-King is used the nameserver's cache would contain fewer entries than OKing, but those entries would be entirely useless to local users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. TURBO KING</head><p>In this section we propose Turbo King (T-King) to address the drawbacks previously highlighted. We start by giving a high-level overview of the system then finish the section with detailed descriptions of the various components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Design</head><p>Turbo King is a stand-alone service that accepts as arguments the IP addresses of end-hosts A and B from the Internet and returns the estimated latency from host A to B. It is currently implemented to resolve single estimate requests for end-host pairs. Further information on the deployment of TKing can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>To accomplish this goal, Turbo King maintains a large list S of N nameservers positioned throughout the Internet, which includes both recursive nameservers and non-recursive authoritative nameservers found in the DNS hierarchy. This list allows us to discover the closest nameserver without relying strictly on heuristic methods or assuming that the authoritative nameserver responsible for A's IP address is the closest nameserver to A. Turbo King first uses BGP data <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to match the IP address of A to a recursive nameserver. If a match is found, the two are likely to reside in the same network. If no matching nameserver is found in the same network as the end-host, we simply find the recursive nameserver that has the longest matching prefix to A or select the default nameserver authoritative for A's IP address. Turbo King then repeats the same process for B but expands the set of possible nameservers to include those that are not recursive. This is done because the target nameserver need not resolve recursive queries for the estimate to succeed.</p><p>Given the two nameservers, Turbo King then generates a latency estimate between them (the algorithm is described below) and returns the result. T-King operates in one of two modes. The default is passive, whereby T-King waits for requests before generating latency estimates. Estimates are cached for a configurable amount of time (e.g., 30 minutes) such that subsequent requests using the same two nameservers do not trigger a new measurement. This mode puts the least strain on resources as it only visits popular destinations. The optional mode we call active, in which Turbo King preemptively takes latency estimates between nameservers on the list so as to eventually obtain an entire N × N delay matrix. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> This mode consumes more resources and possibly produces estimates that are never used, but it reduces the user-perceived delay and allows the matrix to be directly downloaded for use in applications and other research studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Discovering Nameservers</head><p>Turbo King is most effective when its list S of nameservers is large, such that at least one nameserver is "close" to every IP address that is currently in use on the Internet. The current version of T-King compiles its list of nameservers by performing exhaustive crawls 4 of the IN-ADDR.ARPA reverse DNS tree using the techniques introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, which accepts cached (i.e., non-authoritative) entries to queries because they are only interested in the number of hosts represented in the tree, our crawler probes the entire depth of the reverse tree by accepting only authoritative answers, which maximizes the number of nameservers found. Results from this crawl are presented in the next section, but we should note that significantly larger datasets can be built using other techniques (e.g., N = 333, 963 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and over 580, 000 using port-53 scanning <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>). We are considering the intrusiveness and overhead of these approaches for later augmenting set S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Measurement Algorithm</head><p>Our proposed algorithm is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref>, where Turbo King operates as a multi-threaded application with both the client and server operations communicating seamlessly. This allows timestamps to be taken for every packet sent or received by our software, which reduces the number of queries required to complete an estimate. During step <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> For N = 117, 863 used in the current version and one query per 22 seconds per DNS server, the entire matrix consisting of 13.8 billion measurements can be built in 30 days. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Analysis shows that 85% of nameservers found by T-King in Nov. 2006 were active in Dec. 2007, which suggests that monthly or even annual rescanning of the tree should keep the DNS server set relatively fresh.  1, DNSClient takes a timestamp and initiates a query to ns.example.com for the domain we control, namely irl-tamu.us. Since DNSServer is listed with the .us registrar as the authoritative nameserver for this domain, host ns.example.com recursively queries DNSServer in step 2. At step 3, our software takes another timestamp and answers with a referral saying that ns1.target.com is authoritative for the query, but sets the TTL for this information to zero, meaning that it should not be cached <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Nameserver ns.example.com then directly queries ns1.target.com, which answers with some form of error indication (steps 4-5). That error indication is forwarded back to DNSClient in step 6, which then takes the third and final timestamp, allowing us to estimate the latency between nameservers ns.example.com and ns1.target.com as d 36 − d 12 where d ij is the delay between steps i and j. Thus, Turbo King is able to determine the latency between ns.example.com and ns1.target.com without seeding the cache of ns.example.com by judiciously taking timestamps at every point of communication between ns.example.com and the T-King software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Detection and Avoidance of Forwarders</head><p>While both O-King and D-King are unable to detect forwarders, they are simple to detect with Turbo King due to its integrated infrastructure and can be eliminated from the measurement. Because T-King acts as both the client and the server application for the latency estimate, it simply compares the IP addresses that are used to contact DNSClient and DNSServer respectively for a particular query. If different IP addresses are used, T-King excludes the original IP from the list of recursive nameservers and determines if the forwarder allows for recursion, adding it to the list of possible nameservers if so. A new closest server to the IP is retrieved from the list of recursive nameservers and the latency estimate restarts. While there is some small additional delay in returning an answer to the end-user when in passive mode, the resulting estimate is not tainted by the presence of a forwarder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EVALUATION</head><p>In this section we evaluate the effectiveness of Turbo King for providing accurate latency measurements and its suitability for large-scale studies compared to O-King and D-King. We start by discussing our efforts to discover a large number of nameservers, then perform several real-world measurements to compare the three algorithms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Results from Reverse DNS Crawl</head><p>Because of the large number of queries required to complete the IN-ADDR.ARPA crawl, we designed and implemented a multi-threaded DNS resolver to collect a list of nameservers and authority data for all zones in the reverse lookup tree. The results of one particular crawl executed in November 2006 are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table I</ref>, where both Turbo King and ISC <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> found roughly the same number of IP addresses in the tree; however, our crawler was approximately seven times faster and discovered 2.4 times more nameservers. Examination of the nameservers we discovered revealed that 117, 817 of them support recursive queries. Using the T-King client, we profiled each of the recursive nameservers in our list and found that 32% use a forwarder to resolve queries for zones not under their control.</p><p>We next study the coverage of the Internet by all discovered nameservers and the subset of nameservers that are recursive, which is illustrated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table II</ref>. This data shows that Turbo King contains a nameserver in 190 countries, covering over 13 thousand ASes, 48 thousand BGP prefixes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and 1.03 billion IP addresses out of 1.6 billion advertised by BGP <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. We performed further analysis of how well the discovered BGP prefixes cover 3.5 million Gnutella peers found in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and 3.6 million web servers (hosting over 6.3 billion webpages) found by our unrelated web-crawling project. These numbers show that 49% of peers and 88% of web servers reside in BGP prefixes that contain at least one nameserver discovered by T-King.</p><p>For the subset of nameservers that are recursive, Turbo King found nameservers in 174 countries, representing nearly 11 thousand ASes, 31 thousand BGP prefixes, and 828 million IP addresses. This resulted in a coverage of 37% of Gnutella peers and 73% of webservers. While T-King is able to find a nameserver in the same network for a large percentage of endhosts (especially web servers), the relatively low percentage of Gnutella peers covered indicates that we should aim to discover more recursive resolvers used by home-based Internet connections in the future.</p><p>1) Analyzing zone authority data: Of further interest is the percentage of zones in the reverse lookup tree that contain multiple authoritative nameservers, which we examined by recording the set of nameservers authoritative for every zone during the IN-ADDR.ARPA crawl. The accuracy of O-King estimates is only significantly affected if one or more of the nameservers for a zone is in a different network, making it likely for O-King to produce conflicting results over multiple samples. We downloaded 219, 110 BGP prefixes from RouteViews <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and matched each nameserver's IP to one or more prefixes, then examined the nameserver set for every zone in the reverse lookup tree. We found that 49% of reverse lookup zones contain at least one nameserver in their set that is in a different network. While this is a striking result, it is possible that the unmatched nameserver could be in another network under the same administrative control that is well-connected to the rest of the nameservers in the set. Accurately determining administrative control for a large number of networks is difficult, but it stands to reason that if all nameservers for a zone share a single domain name, they are more likely to be under one organization's administrative control. While the process is easy for generic top-level domains (gTLDs), it is significantly more complex for countrycoded TLDs (ccTLDs) as most countries created sub-domains from which people could purchase their own domains (e.g., .com.es). We compiled a comprehensive list of these subdomains for each ccTLD and hereby refer to this list and the set of gTLDs as pay-level domains (PLDs). We again evaluated the nameserver set for each zone and found that 33% have at least one nameserver in their authority set that both resides in a different network and has a different PLD than the other nameservers. It is very likely that the accuracy of O-King queries for these zones will be negatively impacted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Causes of Inaccuracy</head><p>In this section we compare O-King and D-King to Turbo King using latency estimates they produce from the Internet. To remove variability caused by differences in architecture, we implemented all three algorithms using the same timing and socket mechanisms and ran all of the tests from a single Windows 2003 x64 machine. To highlight the differences in accuracy, we focus only on the actual latency estimate between nameservers and note that T-King should perform no worse than O-King or D-King in selecting a "close" recursive nameserver. In many cases it will perform better, but we leave such analysis for future work.</p><p>1) Zones with Multiple Authoritative Nameservers: To illustrate the impact of authoritative nameservers in different networks on O-King estimates, we chose a zone with two authoritative nameservers and used O-King to generate 100 latency estimates to a target IP in the zone. We then used DKing to estimate the latency to the two individual authoritative nameservers for the zone. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 6(a)</ref>  are represented as lines. O-King performs as expected and vacillates between the two nameservers arbitrarily. This is further demonstrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6(b)</ref>, where roughly 60% of the time O-King chose NS 1 as the preferred server. We confirmed that this behavior also occurs in zones with more than two nameservers, but omit these examples for brevity.</p><p>We next analyze the convergence properties of O-King measurements for zones with multiple authoritative nameservers.</p><p>To determine exactly what happens to the latency estimate when the number of samples increases, we use the measurement data from above and plot in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>(a) the CDF of latency estimates for sample sizes one through five. From inspecting the figure, it quickly becomes apparent that the higher latency samples are ignored and are effectively removed from the overall estimate as the sample size increases. This is further illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7(b)</ref>, where the latency estimated by OKing using four samples is plotted with D-King measurements using one sample. As the figure clearly shows, the O-King measurement is nearly identical to the measurement given by D-King to NS 1.</p><p>There are two insights that can be gained from this behavior. The first is that the requirement of at least four samples per measurement proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> for O-King is at least partially due to the natural differences in latency between multiple authoritative nameservers for a particular zone. In contrast, D-King provides the same latency estimate with one sample in this case. The second issue is that O-King always biases its estimates towards the lowest latency nameserver of a zone. While in some cases this might be the server located closest to the target end-host, there is no evidence that this happens in the general case.</p><p>2) DNS Forwarders: The impact of forwarders on both OKing and D-King latency estimates largely depends on the proximity of the forwarder to the original recursive nameserver. If the two servers are on the same local network, any additional latency should be rather small. To quantify the likelihood of this event, we matched both the forwarder and the original recursive nameserver to their advertised BGP prefixes from RouteViews <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and discovered that 45% of the time the two servers did not reside on the same network. To demonstrate the inaccuracy introduced by the presence of forwarders, we took 100 latency estimates using all three algorithms from a recursive nameserver known to use a forwarder to a zone with a single authoritative nameserver (this rules out effects from multiple authoritative nameservers on O-King). The resulting latency estimates are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 8(a)</ref>, which compares O-King to T-King, and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 8(b)</ref>, which compares D-King to T-King. In both figures O-King and D-King overestimate latency due to the presence of the forwarder, whereas T-King does not. The D-King estimate is larger than O-King due to multiple attempts to resolve the query by the forwarder, a problem that is mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and accounted for in T-King.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Measurement-based Comparison</head><p>To study Turbo King in more depth, we performed 2, 450 latency estimates on the Internet using 50 recursive nameservers from the previously discovered set for both T-King and O-King over various measurement sample sizes. From this data we show that T-King measurements are indeed different from those produced by O-King. We then show that Turbo King converges to a consistent latency estimate in two samples instead of the four suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. D-King is omitted from this section due to space constraints, but the results are consistent with those found in the previous section. D-King is more accurate than O-King, but less so than T-King due to its inability to detect forwarders. nameserver using a recursive nameserver that we verified does not use a forwarder. Because we eliminated all of the factors that skew O-King estimates, the two should produce the same value. The result is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9(a)</ref>, with the estimates produced by O-King as data points and the average estimate by T-King as a line to allow the reader to distinguish between the two. The figure clearly shows that T-King produces latency estimates that are equivalent to O-King in such idealized cases.</p><p>We next compare the 2, 450 latency estimates produced by Turbo King to those by O-King, which is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9(b)</ref>. To highlight differences between the two, we generated a ratio of the estimates by dividing O-King's value by T-King's, so that if O-King and T-King produced identical values, the CDF would be a straight line at one on the x-axis. Note that in this case we used four samples for each estimate as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. From the data, 15% of O-King estimates are more than 10% different from T-King measurements, and 8% of OKing measurements are more than 20% different from those generated by T-King.</p><p>2) Convergence of Estimates: Previously, we showed that zones with multiple authoritative nameservers are one of the reasons O-King requires at least four samples to produce a latency estimate. In this section, we expand that study by examining the convergence properties of both T-King and OKing, showing that over a wide range of estimates Turbo King converges to a consistent estimate with fewer samples than required by O-King. To accomplish this, we repeated the above 2, 450 latency estimates using sample sizes varying from one to four for both algorithms. We collected two estimates for each sample size and calculated the ratio of both O-King to O-King and T-King to T-King. The goal is to provide consistent estimates for latency, so we plotted the CDF of the ratio in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10(a)</ref> for O-King and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10(b)</ref> for T-King, with each line representing the number of samples used to produce the estimate. In the O-King case, illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.  10(a)</ref>, improvement in the consistency of estimates is apparent as the number of samples increases to four, whereas in the Turbo King case <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10(b)</ref>) the greatest improvement is from one sample to two, with little afterward. From these graphs we conclude that the recommendation of four samples in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> is sound for O-King and that T-King produces an accurate sample using only two samples. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Overhead Analysis</head><p>In this section we study the resources required of DNS nameservers and the Internet for all three algorithms. In particular, we are interested in how the three compare for large-scale estimates involving more than 100, 000 recursive nameservers discovered by Turbo King. We start by examining the number of queries sent to capture the network overhead, then discuss cache pollution for large-scale measurements.</p><p>1) Network Overhead: To study network overhead, we consider the number of queries required to perform all-toall latency estimates for the 100, 000 recursive nameservers, which is 10 billion estimates. In this calculation, we included every query initiated either by or on behalf of the measurement client, and used the number of samples required to produce consistent latency estimates: four for O-King and two for DKing and T-King. Due to the lack of seeding, Turbo King requires 70 billion queries to complete 10 billion latency estimates. D-King needs 100 billion queries for the measurement, which is 1.43 times more than required by T-King. Finally, OKing uses 150 billion queries, or 2.14 times more than Turbo King and 1.5 times more than D-King. Thus, designing T-King to be more accurate and to avoid seeding led to a significant reduction in bandwidth usage.</p><p>We next consider the impact each algorithm has on DNS caches under the same measurement conditions.</p><p>2) Cache Pollution: We examine cache pollution by calculating the total number of DNS records inserted into the cache of the 100, 000 recursive nameservers. Each entry includes two records, an NS record and an A (IP address) record. Since O-King causes recursive nameservers to seed the cache with every authoritative nameserver for a zone, we used the reverse crawl data to find an average of 2.4 nameservers per zone. Thus, O-King would cause the insertion of 48 billion entries into cache for the nameservers used in the measurement. D-King needs a single set of records for each latency estimate, which means that 20 billion entries would be saved in caches on its behalf. Turbo King only requires that the local domain (e.g., irl-tamu.us) be cached at each recursive nameserver, which implies merely 200, 000 total cache pollution entries. To compare, Turbo King requires 0.0004% of the total entries caused by O-King and 0.001% of those initiated by D-King, clearly making Turbo King much more appropriate for large-scale measurement studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we proposed the Turbo King latency estimation framework and showed that it was more accurate than prior methods while at the same time requiring fewer samples to produce an accurate latency measurement and scaling significantly better in terms of overhead and cache pollution. More information on the deployment of Turbo King can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Future work includes running T-King in active mode on the Internet, locating more nameservers to increase coverage for home-based end-users, verifying existing distance estimation techniques, and creating a system that leverages both theoretical approaches and actual latency estimates on the Internet.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

accomplished by a simple iterative query that can be repeated

of use; however, it has certain drawbacks that we discuss in 
the remainder of this section.
