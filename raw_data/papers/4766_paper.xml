				<p>Network researchers commonly use reverse DNS lookups of router names to provide geographic or topo-logical information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. By systematically examining a large ISP, we find that a certain percentage of these names are incorrect. We develop techniques to automatically identify these mis-namings, and determine the actual locations, which we validate against the configuration of the ISP&apos;s routers. While the actual number of misnamings is small, these errors induce a large number of false links in the inferred connectivity graph. We also measure the effects on path inflation, and find that the misnamings make path inflation and routing problems appear much worse than they actually are. Finally, we discuss other metrics that may be affected, and avenues for future research in this area.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>When trying to extract topology and routing data from a network, one common approach used by network researchers is to infer the location of network elements (such as routers) using reverse DNS lookups. Large ISPs often have naming conventions that embed topological or geographic information in the router's DNS name, enabling outsiders to infer information that would otherwise require explicit cooperation from the ISP. For example, decoding router names presented in the course of a traceroute with reverse DNS lookup can provide information about which cities are traversed by a network path. Using this approach, previous research has taken advantage of this information to map ISP topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> and estimate network distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13]</ref>.</p><p>While using router DNS name information has generally been proven to be useful, errors can occur for a variety of reasons, affecting the conclusions drawn from this data. Router interfaces are often given DNS names manually by network operators, often as a troubleshooting convenience rather than as a primary addressing mechanism. As routers and line cards are moved, reconfigured, or cycled out of service for repairs or upgrades, and as IP addresses are reassigned across the ISP's network, the DNS information may not be properly updated. As a result, the reverse DNS lookup information becomes out of date, and inferences drawn from it are inaccurate. These naming errors may persist for long periods, particularly if they have no effect on normal network operationsthe network operators may never need to perform troubleshooting on the incorrectly-named interfaces. However, external researchers attempting to analyze the ISP's network may be affected by these misnamed interfaces.</p><p>Without correcting for these DNS misnamings, researchers may get misleading or even conflicting results when applying inference techniques based on DNS names. We are unaware of any examination of the errors in this approach and their implications. In this work, we present the first systematic study on DNS misnamings, with validated results. Our contributions are as follow:</p><p>• We introduce techniques for detecting misnamings, based on observing "abnormal" paths via traceroute. For example, we search for stable paths that appear to visit the same city-level point-of-presence (POP) more than once.</p><p>• We develop heuristics for identifying misnamed IP addresses and fixing them by correlating traceroutes from multiple vantage points. We apply our techniques to a large ISP and validate our results by comparing with the ISP's router configuration data.</p><p>• We examine the topological impact of DNS misnamings. Although DNS misnamings only occur in a small portion (0.5%) of IP addresses, their topological impact is disproportionately larger-we find that 11% of edges in a Rocketfuel-like network topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> are actually false edges.</p><p>• We find that DNS misnaming has an even greater impact on path inflation. Correcting the misnamed addresses reduces the tail of the path inflation distribution by more than 50%.</p><p>In the rest of this paper, we describe the system we developed to map the ISP, how we find and resolve the naming problems, and how we determine the impact of the naming problems on the topology and routing measurements. We have performed these measurements on one large ISP, and have verified with them that the misnamings exist and that our solutions are correct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Inferring POP-Level ISP Topologies</head><p>To understand why DNS misnaming can be such a problem for researchers, it helps to understand how modern ISP networks are constructed, and what complicates the process of inferring the topology. At a high level, an ISP's network can be viewed as a map showing which cities have Points-of-Presence (POPs), and the links that connect these POPs. The POPs contains the routers that connect the ISP's links, and may also provide easy access to links of other peer ISPs and customers. These routers have multiple interfaces, each of which has a separate IP address, which may also have DNS names configured for reverse lookups. A POP may also consist of multiple interconnected routers, rather than a single, larger router. The difficulty for the outside observer is that tools like traceroute report the IP addresses of the interfaces on the forwarding path, not the POPs that are traversed. To determine the POP-level topology, the interface IP addresses must be mapped to their corresponding POPs. While the network operators have this information readily available to them, external researchers do not, and must use some other means to infer it.</p><p>The Salt Lake City Salt Lake City <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Misnaming can shift routers across POPs, yielding multiple edges between a pair of POPs ferred topologies are erroneous. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the actual path consists of one router in Boston, followed by three routers in a POP in New York City. The inferred topology has a POP loop because the DNS name of IP 3 is misconfigured with a name that suggests the interface is located in Los Angeles. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we see a simple topology consisting of many routers in a large POP in San Francisco, with connections to Seattle and Salt Lake City. Reverse DNS lookup of IP 3 suggests the router is within Seattle while it is actually inside San Francisco. DNS misnaming causes three major effects on topology inference:</p><p>• Path inflation: In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we see that if the second NYC router is misnamed as Los Angeles, the path appears to go from Boston to NYC to Los Angeles before returning to NYC. This apparent POPlevel "loop" makes the path appear needlessly inflated, since the Los Angeles round-trip is unnecessary. The effect on inferred path inflation can be severe, particularly for short paths.</p><p>• False edges: If the New York POP in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> does not have any real links to Los Angeles, the misnamed router would lead to the mistaken conclusion that these POPs are directly connected. This would add an erroneous edge to the inferred topology.</p><p>• Extra inter-POP links: In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, both ends of the link from San Francisco to Seattle are labeled as being in Seattle. This causes the densely-connected intra-POP links in San Francisco to appear as multiple links to Seattle. Though technically possible, such redundant links are unlikely, since a smaller number of higher-capacity links would require less hardware and less expense.</p><p>• Missing edges: If router 3 in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> were misnamed as another city, such as Los Angeles, then the traceroute path would not contain a direct connection between San Francisco and Seattle. This could cause the inferred topology to miss the presence of a real link between the two POPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Collection</head><p>To map the ISP topology, we perform distributed traceroutes that traverse many paths of the network under study. The reason for distributed traceroutes is not only to improve coverage of the ISP's links, but also to view mislabeled IP addresses from multiple vantage points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Traceroute Measurements</head><p>Our measurement process consists of collecting traceroute measurements from a large set of geographicallydistributed nodes. We perform traceroutes from 132 diverse nodes on PlanetLab <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> To study the misnaming of a specific ISP, we first pick the traceroutes that traverse the target ISP. We use the BGP tables to map IPs to their autonomous systems (ASes). The mapping is constructed by inspecting the last AS, termed the origin AS, in the AS path for each prefix <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Some IP addresses may map to multiple origin ASes (MOAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, in which case we consider it part of the target ISP if one of the origin ASes is that ISP. With the IP-to-AS mapping, we can then identify all the traceroutes that intersect with the target ISP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">IP-to-POP Mapping</head><p>To study misnamings, we also need the POP-level information of the traceroutes. We perform the reverse DNS lookups of the IP addresses encountered by traceroute, and then use the parsing rules of the undns tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> to extract POP-level information. Version 0.1.27 of undns has parsing rules for 247 ASes. For our target AS, we added some new city names for POP names that were not present in undns.</p><p>With the POP-level information of an IP, we use the longitude and latitude of the city as an estimate of the geographic location of that POP <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . This enables us to calculate the geographic distance between two POPs. We will discuss this in more detail in Section 5.3, where we quantify the impact of misnaming on path inflation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Identifying and Correcting Misnamings</head><p>In this section, we present our algorithms for identifying misnamed router interfaces and associating them with the right POPs. Our basic insight is that misnamed interfaces typically lead to abnormal POP-level paths. When we correlate traceroutes from multiple vantage points, these misnamed interfaces are traversed repeatedly, leading to many abnormal paths. As a result, we can identify them by looking for the IP addresses that appear frequently in abnormal paths. We propose two heuristics for detecting and correcting misnamed interfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">POP-Level Loop</head><p>Normally, a path inside an ISP should not contain a POPlevel loop. This is because ASes typically employ intradomain routing protocols that compute shortest paths based on link weights. The weights on inter-POP links are usually much larger than those of intra-POP links, to reduce propagation delay and avoid overloading expensive long-haul links 2 . Therefore, for stable paths, the traffic that passes through a POP should not return to the same POP again.</p><p>To determine which IP address in a POP-level loop has been mislabeled, we leverage our distributed traceroutes. Misnamed IPs are likely to appear repeatedly in the abnormal paths when we combine the traceroutes from multiple locations. Assuming we have a collection of stable paths with POP-level loops, a simple strategy is to count how many times each IP appears and pick the ones that appear most frequently. However, this strategy may not work well, because it treats all the IPs equally. For example, a correctly-named IP address may appear frequently, simply because it is close to a misnamed IP.</p><p>To handle this problem, we make an assumption that most DNS entries are correct and misnamings do not occur very often. (We will see in Section 5 that this assumption is true for the ISP we study.) This means we could resolve all the POP-level loops by fixing only a small number of misnamed IP addresses. We devise a greedy algorithm to solve this problem.</p><p>For each abnormal path with a POP-level loop, we have several possible candidates for misnamings. For each interface in the path, we test the following hypothesis: can we resolve the loop by mapping this address to a different POP? If we can, we consider this IP a candidate of misnamed IP of this path. For instance, in the inferred path in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the second and the fourth IPs are candidates, since we can break the loop by mapping either of them to the Los Angeles POP. The third IP is also a candidate, because we can resolve the loop by mapping it to New York. In this way, we can obtain a set of candidate misnamings for each abnormal path.</p><p>To identify the most viable candidate, we consider all abnormal paths together. The key observation is that, although a correctly-named IP may be in the candidate set of some abnormal paths, it typically would not appear in many other abnormal paths where it is not in the candidate set. As a result, re-labeling this address would not help resolve the loops in those paths.</p><p>The pseudocode of our greedy algorithm for identifying misnamed IPs is shown below. We first compute the candidate set for each abnormal path. Then we greedily pick a candidate IP that helps to resolve loops for many paths, while at the same time seldom appears in a path where renaming it does not resolve its loop. Finally, we remove the paths whose loops can be resolved by the selected IP and output this IP. This process continues until there are no abnormal paths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>For each abnormal path</head><p>Compute the candidate set of misnamed IPs; While the set of abnormal paths is not empty Compute the union of all candidate sets; For each candidate IP in the union set Count the number of paths where it is in their candidate set, CountCandidate; Count the number of paths where it appears but not in their candidate set, CountNotCandidate; Pick CandidateIP with the max value of CountCandidate -CountNotCandidate; Remove all the abnormal paths whose loop can be resolved by fixing CandidateIP; Output CandidateIP;</p><p>After identifying the misnamed IPs, the next question we want to ask is: can we find the correct POPs of those misnamed IPs by only examining the traceroute data? If so, we can then resolve the misnamings without the ISP's internal data. This means we can supplement the existing topology mapping systems with this DNS name autocorrecting mechanism to achieve higher accuracy.</p><p>As we just described, we test if we can resolve a loop by mapping an IP to a different POP. We often have multiple choices-for example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we can map IP 4 to Los Angeles, St. Louis, or any other POP that does not appear in the path to resolve the loop. However, we suspect that IP 4 is more likely to be in Los Angeles or St. Louis than in some other random POP because it is connected to both POPs. Therefore, we assign a misnamed IP to a POP by voting based on its neighbors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. If the majority of them map to the same POP, we consider it the correct POP for that IP. This process is based on the assumption that a router has more intra-POP links than inter-POP links. Given that inter-POP links span much longer distances and are more expensive, we believe this assumption is true for most major ISPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Router-Level Discrepancy</head><p>Traceroute usually reports the IP address of the incoming interface of each router on the forwarding path. For example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, the traceroute only reports IP 1 , IP 3 , and IP 5 along the path. Sometimes, we can infer the IP of the outgoing interfaces from that of the incoming interfaces. We take advantage of the fact that the inter-POP links of many major ISPs are high-speed point-to-point links (e.g., Packet-Over-SONET links). This means the IP addresses at the opposite ends of a link are in the same /30 subnet. In addition, their last two bits are either 01 or 10; 00 and 11 are the network and broadcast addresses, respectively. So, if we know that both IP <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>  We collect all such abnormal IP pairs and assign each individual IP to a router. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, suppose there are three such pairs, (IP 3 , IP 4 ), (IP 3 , IP 7 ), and <ref type="bibr">(IP 3 , IP 8</ref> ). We will assign IP 3 , IP 4 , IP 7 , and IP 8 to the same router. Then for each router, we decide its correct POP by voting. If the majority of its interfaces map to the same POP, we consider it the correct POP of that router, and the IP that maps to a different POP on that router a misnamed IP. For example, suppose IP 4 , IP 7 , and IP 8 map to Chicago while IP 3 maps to Detroit, we infer that IP 3 is misnamed and it should map to Chicago.</p><p>This heuristic may not work if a router is moved to another POP with none of the DNS names of its interfaces being updated. In practice we have never seen such a case. However, even if this case does occur, it will be most likely to be detected as POP-level loops since there will be many misnamed interfaces. We can resolve it by voting based on its neighbors as described in Section 4.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Case Study on a Large ISP</head><p>In this section, we first validate our algorithms for identifying and fixing misnamed IPs by comparing against the router configuration data for a large ISP. We then study the impact of misnamed interfaces on the inferred topology and estimate of path inflation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Validation With Configuration Data</head><p>The ISP under study has hundreds of routers and dozens of POPs at different cities around the United States. We first select the traceroutes that traverse the ISP. As described in Section 3.1, we traced to 265,448 prefixes from 132 nodes on PlanetLab. After applying the IP-to-POP mapping, we discovered 113 POPs, which covers most of the POPs in that ISP. Among the traceroutes that traverse the ISP, we find 1,957 paths with non-transient POP-level loops. Using the algorithm described in Section 4.1, we are able to identify four misnamed IPs, which are listed as IP 1 , IP 2 , IP 3 , and IP 4 in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. By comparing with the router configuration data, we confirm that these four IP addresses are indeed misnamed. In addition, the voting algorithm in Section 4.1 is able to map those misnamed interfaces to their correct POPs.</p><p>Since the ISP is a large backbone provider, most internal links are point-to-point links. We use the router-level discrepancy heuristic described in Section 4.2 to look for misnamed interfaces in all the non-transient traceroute results. This heuristic allows us to identify two more misnamed interfaces-IP 5 and IP 6 in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We again confirm that these interfaces are misnamed and that our voting algorithm maps them to the correct POPs.</p><p>Finally, we check the completeness of our algorithms. Although we are able to identify six misnamed IPs, we fail to detect three misnamings, which are IP 7 , IP 8 , and IP 9 in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. A closer look at the traceroute data reveals that each of the three IPs has only one neighboring POP and is misnamed to its neighboring POP. For example, IP 9 actually resides in City D, which is a nearby suburb of the larger City C in its name; similarly, the misnamed interfaces IP 7 and IP 8 are located in a small City B near a large POP in City A in California. There is no way that we can identify these misnamed interfaces using traceroute. Arguably, this type of misnaming has very limited impact on topology mapping and path inflation, since these are small POPs with a degree of 1 and are misnamed as a big POP that is very nearby.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Impact on Topology Mapping</head><p>As discussed earlier in Section 2, misnamings may lead to false edges in topology mapping. Using the mapping techniques in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, we find that the six misnamed interfaces (IP 1 to IP 6 in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) lead to twenty false edges which do not exist in the real topology. This corresponds to 11% of the total number of inferred edges. We can see that although misnamed IPs are rare, they have a significant influence on topology inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Impact on Path Inflation Studies</head><p>Misnamed IPs may inflate the linearized geographic distance of a path, as we explained briefly in Section 2. We now study to what extent misnamings may affect path inflation. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, we compute the inflation ratio of a path as the ratio of the linearized distance of a path to the geographic distance between the source and the destination. This ratio reflects how much a path is inflated because of network topology constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. We calculate the inflation ratio for every possible IPlevel path inside the ISP. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> compares the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the inflation ratios, before and after correcting the misnamed IPs. The curves are plotted with a logarithmic scale on the y-axis to emphasize the tail of the distribution. Here we focus on the paths that are inflated by more than a factor of two. We can clearly see that a small number of misnamings introduce many unusually long paths. For the paths with inflation ratio over four, more than 50% of them are miscalculated due to misnamed interfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>The pioneering work of Rocketfuel provides techniques for inferring detailed ISP topology using traceroutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. In their work, they tried to filter out false edges by removing the links whose distance to latency ratio exceeds the speed of light. Although this heuristic helps to remove certain false edges, it may still miss those less obvious ones. In a later work, <ref type="bibr">Teixeira et al.</ref> found that the Rocketfuel topology of Sprint has significantly higher path diversity than the real topology because of extra false edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. They suspected this is due to imperfect alias resolution. However, this still cannot explain the POP-level false edges. Our work complements these existing works by identifying that DNS misnamings could be a major source of POP-level false edges. We also propose ways to fix the misnamings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion &amp; Discussion</head><p>We have shown that DNS misnaming, a relatively harmless problem from the network operator's standpoint, can be a much more serious problem for network researchers. A small fraction of misnamed router interfaces gets magnified, leading to a larger fraction of false links in the inferred connectivity graph. These links then cause errors in the path inflation metrics, leading to a mistaken belief that the routing decisions are worse than they actually are. The approaches we have developed to identify and correct the misnaming are able to resolve all of the problems we have observed, which we have verified in consultation with the ISP. Our future plans include conducting similar study on other major ISPs, and to expand the scope of the problems examined.</p><p>One of the other inferred metrics that is likely to be affected by these misnamings is path asymmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Even if packets traverse the exact same set of links in both directions, the addresses reported by traceroute will differ in the two directions, so a misnaming of a single interface will give the appearance of asymmetric paths. While we are interested in determining how much false asymmetry arises from misnamed interfaces, it requires cooperation at both endpoints to generate and compare traceroute traffic in both directions. Our current infrastructure does not provide this capability, since we do not control the destination endpoint. It may be possible to model a large ISP and use intra-AS routing information to separate the causes of perceived asymmetry, but this effort requires more explicit data from the ISP than we currently have. Our current approach only uses explicit information from the ISP for verification, not for problem identification.</p><p>Additionally, misnaming may provide a false sense of security when inferring shared fate of links-misnaming may give someone the mistaken impression that two paths with the same source and destination traverse different cities, and would therefore not use the same physical POPs. Especially in the cases where real links exists between the cities, even a moderately careful inspection would provide a false impression that the paths do not share fate. In this scenario, misnaming could affect an organization's disaster recovery planning, rather than affecting the analyses of external researchers.</p><p>Our larger goal is to raise awareness of this kind of problem so that network researchers performing inference-based analysis become aware of the possibility that a large number of anomalous results may stem from a small number of input errors, instead of automatically assuming that the network itself is anomalous. Beyond just prodding other researchers re-examine their approach in using DNS names for topological or geographic data, our longer-term goals are to stimulate new research into automatically detecting and resolving these problems, as well as to identify other research areas where this kind of mislabeling may exist. Given how easily unchecked DNS errors can cause serious misinterpretations of traceroute data, we believe that other network measurement may be similarly affected.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Misnaming causing a POP loop and extra edges.
