				<p>Concepts are sequences of words that represent real or imaginary entities or ideas that users are interested in. As a first step towards building a web of concepts that will form the backbone of the next generation of search technology, we develop a novel technique to extract concepts from large datasets. We approach the problem of concept extraction from corpora as a market-baskets problem [2], adapting statistical measures of support and confidence. We evaluate our concept extraction algorithm on datasets containing data from a large number of users (e.g., the AOL query log data set [11]), and we show that a high-precision concept set can be extracted.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The next generation of search and discovery of information on the web will involve a richer understanding of the user's intent, and a better presentation of relevant information instead of the familiar "ten blue links" model of search results. This transformation will create a more engaging search environment for the users, helping them quickly find the information they need. Search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Bing have already started displaying richer information for some search queries, including maps and weather (for location searches), reviews and prices (for product search queries), and profiles (for people searches). However, this information is surfaced only for a small subset of the search queries, and in most other cases, the search engine provides only links to web pages.</p><p>In order to provide a richer search experience for users, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> argues that web-search companies should organize search back-end information around a web of concepts. Concepts, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>, refer to entities, events and topics that are of interest to users who are searching for information. For example, the string "Homma's Sushi", representing a popular restaurant, is a concept. In addition to concepts, the web of concepts contains meta data corresponding to concepts (for example, hours of operation for Homma's Sushi), and connections between concepts (for example, "Homma's Sushi" is related to "Seafood Restaurants"). A web of concepts would not only allow search engines to identify user intent better, but also to rank content better, support more expressive queries and present the integrated information better.</p><p>Our definition of a concept is based on its usefulness to people.</p><p>Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material is granted provided that the copies are not made or distributed for direct commercial advantage, the VLDB copyright notice and the title of the publication and its date appear, and notice is given that copying is by permission of the Very Large Data Base Endowment. To copy otherwise, or to republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires a fee and/or special permission from the publisher, ACM. VLDB '10, September 13-17, 2010, Singapore Copyright 2010 VLDB Endowment, ACM 000-0-00000-000-0/00/00.</p><p>That is, a string is a concept if a "significant" number of people say it represents an entity, event or topic known to them. For instance, "Flying Pigs Shoe Store" is not a concept if only one or two people know about this store, even though this store may have a web page where "Flying Pigs Shoe Store" appears. As we discuss later, we also avoid "super-concepts" that have shorter equivalent concepts. For example, "The Wizard Harry Potter" is not a concept because "Harry Potter" is a concept identifying the same character. As we will see, other reasons why we restrict our definition to sequences of words that are popular and concise are scalability and precision.</p><p>At <ref type="bibr">Kosmix (www.kosmix.com)</ref>, we have been working on designing search around a web of concepts. Our aim at Kosmix is to automatically build a "concept page" with information for each known concept, giving among other things useful links and a list of related concepts. As soon as the search engine knows a user is looking for a known concept, it can display the concept page to help the user navigate and discover useful information.</p><p>The first step in building the Kosmix web of concepts is to extract concepts from data sources of various kinds: web-pages, query logs, tag datasets etc. A good source of concepts is the online user edited encyclopedia Wikipedia (wikipedia.org), currently with about 2.5 million articles. Since each article has been carefully selected by many Wikipedia editors, the titles of these articles are likely to correspond to what many people regard as concepts.</p><p>Even though Wikipedia can yield many concepts, we still wish to identify additional concepts. In particular, new concepts may arise because of current events. Also, many well known restaurants, hotels, scientific concepts, locations, companies, and so on, do not have Wikipedia entries. Thus, the concept extraction scheme we present plays a vital role in building the Kosmix web of concepts.</p><p>In addition to assisting in the search back-end, extracting concepts can also be very useful for other tasks, e.g., query correction, selective indexing and tag/query suggestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</p><p>In this work we develop a novel technique of extracting concepts from data sets. We use frequency or popularity of words as an inherent signal to distinguish whether a sequence of words forms a concept relative to the word sequences contained within it (subconcepts), and relative to the word sequences that contain it (superconcepts). Our technique can be applied to any data set containing aggregated information from a large number of users, for example, a query log or a tag data set, or even a large web-document crawl. Frequency information allows us to prune away the additional words in "super-concepts", leaving only the core concept. Since popularity of words plays a key role, it is more effective to use a dataset with a high "density" of concepts, such a query log or a set of tags. If we use a set of Web pages for extraction then we need to do a lot more processing to identify the popular terms.</p><p>Our work builds upon a lot of related research in the areas of market-basket mining and term recognition. However, because concepts are not quite frequent item-sets or terms, most existing methods do not directly apply. For example, a simple market-baskets approach cannot be used to extract concepts as frequent item-sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>, because we wish to discard both sub-concepts and super-concepts while only keeping the concept that we consider to be "good" (as we will see in Sec. 2.5). For example, we wish to discard 'Rage against the' or 'Against the machine' (sub-concepts), and 'Rage against the machine music' or 'Rage against the machine band' (super-concepts), and keep the concept 'Rage against the machine'(A popular rock/metal group). Similarly, most term recognition algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref> do not consider popularity. For example, a word-sequence 'Ayocaria Rnfection' (a misspelling of 'Myocardial Infarction') may occur once in a document (and hence is not a concept, since it is not a popular entity), but will be considered as a term. However, we do compare our algorithm against a statistical technique for term recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> that takes popularity into account. We return to this point in Sec. 4. We do not primarily rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques because they would not be of use when concepts are devoid of a free-text context <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27]</ref>, such as in the query log or tag dataset case. In summary, our contributions are the following: • We formulate the problem of concept extraction from large datasets.</p><p>• We provide a novel technique for solving the problem of concept extraction, and prove the correctness of this technique under some assumptions.</p><p>• We experimentally evaluate our technique against those used for term recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref>.</p><p>• We experimentally study our technique on varying various parameters for both precision and recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CONCEPT EXTRACTION</head><p>We first define a k-gram as a ordered sequence of k words occurring one after the other in text. e.g., "Mary had a little lamb" has three 3-grams: 'Mary had a', 'had a little' and 'a little lamb', and one 5-gram, which is the entire sequence of words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Definition of a Concept</head><p>We define a concept (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>) to be a k-gram that represents a real or imaginary entity, event or idea that many users may be interested in (i.e., is popular), and does not contain any extraneous words such that excluding them would identify the same entity (i.e., is concise). In this paper, we do not delve into any philosophical discussions on the correctness of this definition, involving ourselves instead on how we may use frequency information or popularity to give indications as to whether a sequence of words forms a concept.</p><p>For our evaluation of automatically extracted concepts, we assume all Wikipedia article titles to be concepts 1 , since Wikipedia has a rigorous screening process to delete any article that "does not indicate why [the concept] is important or significant" <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In addition, we use human evaluators to judge if the k-grams we extract are concepts.</p><p>Note that enforcing the properties of popularity and conciseness is also helpful in other ways: For instance, by restricting ourselves to popular concepts, we exclude concepts of interest to only a small fraction of people, and by restricting ourselves to concise concepts, we remove duplicates in the web of concepts, thereby allowing us</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Extraction of k-grams</head><p>Consider a large dataset C, that could be a query log, a web document crawl, text from a set of books, etc. A pre-processing step extracts all k-grams and annotates them with the frequency of their occurrence in C. For example, if 'Milky Way Galaxy' was a query term in dataset C, when we process this query, we would increment the frequency of 1-grams 'Milky', 'Way' and 'Galaxy', 2-grams 'Milky Way' and 'Way Galaxy' and 3-gram 'Milky Way Galaxy'. For documents from the web, we treat each sentence as independent of the others and so we do not count k-grams that span two sentences. For example, 'This is Los Angeles. Here . . .', we would not increase the count of 'Los Angeles Here'. For the web query log, we treat each web query as an independent sentence, as in the dataset of documents from the web.</p><p>To prevent a blowup of k-grams being counted, we impose a cutoff on k, i.e., that k ≤ n. Since very few concepts have greater than 4 words (as seen in Wikipedia), we stop at n = 4. In the following, we assume that we have a k-gram set, for k ≤ 4, annotated with frequencies of occurrence in the dataset C. A k-gram x contains a (k-m)-gram y, where m &gt; 0, if x can be written as w followed by y followed by z, where w and z are sequences of words themselves (not both empty), e.g., 'United Nations Security Council' (a 4-gram) contains 'Security Council' (a 2-gram).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">A Crucial Empirical Property of Concepts</head><p>We claim that concepts most often satisfy the following empirical property. We describe the intuition behind the claim, and then provide some justification by examination of Wikipedia concepts. We use this claim to develop the algorithm in Sec. 2.4 and beyond. CLAIM 1. If a given k-gram a1a2 . . . a k (k &gt; 2) is a concept, then it is not true that both of the following k-1-grams are concepts: a1a2 . . . a k−1 and a2a3 . . . a k . If a 2-gram a1a2 is a concept, then at least one of a1 and a2 are concepts.</p><p>The claim relates whether or not a k-gram can be a concept if the k-1-grams that it contains are concepts. For example, "Who framed Roger" and "Framed Roger Rabbit" do not make sense independently (i.e., are not concepts), but the Walt Disney film, "Who framed Roger Rabbit" makes sense as a concept. In this case, both the 2-grams contained in the 3-gram are not concepts. It is not necessary that both the k-1-grams are not concepts, for instance, consider 3-gram "Manhattan Experimental Theater", which contains the 2-grams "Manhattan Experimental" and "Experimental Theater", the latter of which is a concept.</p><p>However, for k = 2 there are examples of concepts that are formed from two 1-gram concepts. For example, while both "Computer" and "Networks" are independent concepts, "Computer Networks" is a concept in itself.  To provide some justification for the claim, we performed the following experiment on the set of articles in Wikipedia: We assume that the title of each article represents a concept as mentioned in Sec. 1. For a given k, we took the subset of the set of Wikipedia concepts that are k-grams, and counted how many k-grams violated the claim above. The data is represented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. For example, consider the row corresponding to 4-grams. The total number of 4-gram concepts is 681447, out of which 12150 contain two 3-gram concepts (12150/681447 = 1.78%). 202763 contain one or more 3-gram concepts (202763/681447 = 29.8%). While a large fraction (≈ 56%) of concept 2-grams contain two concept 1-grams, this is not true for k-gram concepts for k &gt; 2, none of which have &gt; 8% that contain two k-1-gram concepts.</p><p>Note also that the number of k-gram concepts where at least 1 of the k-1-grams contained is a concept, is large for k-grams in the range 2 . . . 5. We capture this statistic in Claim 1 by saying that we sometimes have one of the k-1-grams as concepts. Additionally, almost 96% of the concept 2-grams contain at least one concept 1-gram. We capture this special case in Claim 1 by saying that all concept 2-grams contain at least one concept 1-gram.</p><p>Because Claim 1 does not always hold, our algorithm, which is based on Claim 1, will make false negative errors, i.e., it will miss some concepts. However, as we will see, the number of such false negatives will be relatively small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Procedural Overview</head><p>To extract concepts, we evaluate the k-grams annotated with frequency as in Sec. 2.2, and extract the ones that we regard to be concepts. We maintain a preliminary set of k-grams and we discard the k-grams that we do not consider to be concepts. We proceed by evaluating k-grams in the order of increasing k (in a bottom-up fashion). If the k-gram x, for k &gt; 2, is a concept, then Claim 1 states that at least one of the k-1-grams that x contains needs to be discarded, since both the k-1-grams cannot be concepts. We do the following while analyzing k-grams for a given k:</p><p>• Either we discard the k-gram, OR • We discard some of the k-1-grams that the k-gram contains, and keep the k-gram. The k-gram overrides the k-1-grams that get discarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Indicators of a Concept</head><p>From the k-gram set above, we wish to decide which of them are concepts. In order to make this decision, we use certain indicators.</p><p>There are three indicators that we expect k-grams that are concepts to possess. Let us take a closer look at these indicators:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•First Indicator: Frequent</formula><p>We expect the frequency of occurrence (as in Sec. 2.2) of a concept a, also called the support Sa, to be high, i.e., Sa is large for a to be a concept.</p><p>•Second Indicator: Better than sub/super-concepts There are two parts to this indicator: We want our concept to be "better" than sub-concepts and "better" than super-concepts.</p><p>Firstly, we expect a concept k-gram to be better than any k-mgrams that it contains, i.e., we want it to have high "confidence", as defined below. Secondly, we expect the k-gram representing the concept to be "better" than super-concepts, i.e., there is no k+1-gram (of all the k+1-grams that contain the k-gram) that is a better concept than the k-gram.</p><p>However, to evaluate both the parts of this indicator, it is sufficient to evaluate k-grams in increasing order of k, and ensure that they are "better" than the k-1-grams (i.e., sub-concepts). We provide justification that this strategy is correct in Appendix A (after making some assumptions).</p><p>To decide if a k-gram is better than k-1-grams, we define a set of metrics. Let the k-gram be a. If a = t1t2 . . . t k , then let b = t1t2 . . . t k−1 be the prefix k-1-gram of a, and c = t2t3 . . . t k be the suffix k-1-gram of a. There are two measures of confidence: pre-confidence pre-conf C1a and post-confidence post-conf C2a, where C1a = Sa/S b , and C2a = Sa/Sc. The pre-conf is nothing but the probability that t k is seen given that we have already seen t1t2t3 . . . t k−1 .</p><p>We define min-confidence min-conf as the minimum of the preconf and the post-conf. The min-conf is useful because it is a lowerbound on the confidence we have on the k-gram relative to the k-1-grams. If a k-gram has its min-conf higher than a threshold (a function of k), then we would prefer keeping the k-gram as a concept than the k-1-grams that it contains (assuming that it satisfies other properties).</p><p>Similarly, max-confidence max-conf is defined as the maximum of pre-and post-conf. The metric max-conf is useful when a subconcept can be followed by many possible phrases/words, e.g., 'John Lennon' (a well-known musician) would have a low min-conf because the pre-conf is very low (since 'John' can be followed by any number of "popular" surnames), however, the max-conf is high because the surname uniquely identifies the first name. Thus, if the max-conf is higher than a certain threshold (a function of k), we would prefer to still consider the k-gram to be a concept. Typically this threshold will be higher than that for min-conf for a given k.</p><p>Another useful metric that we define is the relative confidence, rel-conf of a k-gram. This metric is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">rel-conf(a) = min-conf(a) max(max-conf(b), max-conf(c))</formula><p>where a, b, c are as before. This metric captures our notion that for a k-gram to be a concept, it should be better than any of the k-1-grams that it contains, i.e., if the rel-conf is beyond a certain threshold, we have higher confidence in the k-gram than in either of the k-1-grams.</p><p>The reason we have this metric in addition to the min-conf metric is that it is not sufficient to look at min-conf to decide if a k-gram is worth keeping relative to the k-1-grams that it contains. A high min-conf does not mean that the k-1-grams are not concept-worthy relative to the k-2-grams that they contain, in fact they might be more so than the k-gram relative to the k-1-grams. A high rel-conf (greater than some value dependent on k) would ensure that we are not making a mistake by keeping the k-gram as a concept, and discarding the k-1-grams that it contains.</p><p>We outline the differences between our metrics and term recognition metrics in detail in Sec. 4.</p><p>•Third Indicator: Contains only portions of sentences that convey a single meaning or idea</p><p>Note that the metrics outlined above may not be sufficient to differentiate between concept and non-concept k-grams for some data sources. Consider a dataset of news documents over the past year and consider the example, 'George Bush said yesterday'. This 4-gram is not a concept, but could still be evaluated highly by the metrics above. Commonly occurring portions of sentences, e.g., 'How do I' and 'What does this'. would be other examples of text fragments that could score well on the metrics but are not concepts.</p><p>We therefore need an evaluator that works on k-grams and returns whether or not they can be concepts based on whether or not they contain portions of sentences that do not form a single concise concept. Note that this check is not as complicated in the web query log case, because it is "dense" in concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Using the Indicators</head><p>We define Algorithm 1: conceptExtraction which takes as input the set of k-grams annotated with frequencies and proceeds to extract a set of concepts in a bottom-up fashion. Note that the procedure maintains a set of k-grams that will be discarded at the end of every phase (D).</p><p>Algorithm 1 calls Algorithm 2: candidateConceptCheck to check if a k-gram satisfies the properties mentioned in the first and second indicators in Sec. 2.5. A k-gram that passes the check in Algorithm 2 is called a candidate concept.</p><p>Once the extraction of candidate concepts is complete, the procedure containsStopWords is called by the conceptExtraction procedure (lines 12-17) to eliminate candidate concepts that we do not return as concepts because they do not satisfy the third indicator.</p><p>We now describe the details of algorithm candidateConceptCheck. We will consider containsStopWords subsequently. In candidateConceptCheck, a k-gram is first checked to see if it has requisite support(a function of k) in line 4; i.e., the k-gram occurs frequently enough to be a candidate concept.</p><p>As per the procedure candidateConceptCheck, a k-gram, k &gt; 2 is a candidate concept if it falls into one of three cases, corresponding to various values of pre-conf and post-conf of the k-gram. Either the candidate concept on the whole is "good" (case 1) or is formed by attaching words to the end or beginning of "good" candidate concepts (case 2/3). The first case (9-13) corresponds to both pre-and post-conf being very close to 1. This corresponds to the situation where neither of the k-1-grams contained in the k-gram are judged to be concepts. The min-conf and rel-conf in this case have to surpass some threshold (a function of k). In this case, we keep the k-gram and discard both the k-1-grams. 'Who framed roger rabbit' would be an example of such a concept. The second case <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(17)</ref> corresponds to the post-conf being very close to 1, and the pre-conf small. This corresponds to the case where the prefix k-1-gram is extracted as a concept by itself. We would then expect the post-conf to be larger than some threshold, and also larger than the pre-conf by a factor of dominance-threshold (&gt; 1). We then discard only the non-concept suffix k-1-gram. An example of such a concept would be 'Home Alone 3'. The third case (19-21), e.g., 'Intel Research Labs', is symmetric to the second case.</p><p>Note that we do not consider the case where both pre-and postconf are low. This is because of Claim 1 which states that a kgram concept cannot be formed out of two k-1-gram concepts. The exception in the claim for k = 2 is absorbed into case 1, with the min-conf threshold set suitably low. In this case, both of the 1-grams are concepts, and hence cannot be discarded.</p><p>We prefer a bottom-up over a top-down approach for the algorithm because we do not want to deal with a exploding number of k-grams for larger k. Typically, k-gram concepts will occur with many other words both before and after, giving rise to many k+1-grams which contain the k-gram. If we are analyzing bottom-up, all of these can be discarded because the k-gram has already been isolated as a concept. If we were analyzing top-down, we can't discard any of the k+1-grams because we cannot be sure if there is a k-gram that will override them.</p><p>Procedure containsStopWords is used to prune candidate concepts that are not likely to be concepts because they violate the third indicator. For instance, they could • begin or end with a conjunction, article or pronoun e.g. by, for, and, an, that, from, because, where, how, yesterday or you • begin or end with a verb</p><p>• contain no nouns Thus this procedure detects special words (also called stop words) as in the first item in the list above, and also does part-of-speech (POS) tagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, a technique used to tag each word in a phrase with its part-of-speech, for the second and third items. Note that the example 'George Bush said yesterday' in Sec. 2.5 will be detected by the first item.</p><p>Note that POS tagging and advanced techniques are not required for query logs because they are a much more "refined" data source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1 conceptExtraction: Extract k-grams from a set of k-grams and their frequencies</head><p>Require: l ← set of k-grams with frequencies Sa 1: C ⇐ ∅ {Set of Candidate Concepts} 2: for all k = 1 to n do 3: D ⇐ ∅ {Set of Sub-concepts to discard} 4: for all a ∈ l, a is a k-gram do 5:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(D, Answer) = candidateConceptCheck(a, C, D) 6:</formula><p>if Answer == true then 7: Query logs typically involve queries having multiple concepts one after the other with no extraneous words. For query logs, containsStopWords just detects the first item in the list above (for example, to detect k-grams like 'Where can I find'). Additionally, since most queries do not form a grammatically correct sentence (or portion of it), some NLP techniques cannot be used. However, for the Google k-gram case, a complete POS check as part of the stop word procedure is an integral part of the non-concept pruning.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C ⇐ C ∪</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">The Algorithm: Observations</head><p>In this section we state some observations about the algorithm and how the thresholds work together to ensure that the correct set of concepts are extracted. Proofs can be found in Appendix D. OBSERVATION 1. Whether a k-gram a is extracted as a concept or not does not depend on the order of processing of k-grams, assuming that the k-grams are processed only when processing of k-1-grams is complete.</p><p>OBSERVATION 2. If all other thresholds are fixed, and only the support threshold of k-grams for a certain k is reduced, then the number of k-1-gram concepts extracted can only decrease in number, and their precision can only increase.</p><p>OBSERVATION 3. If all other thresholds are fixed, and only the support threshold of k-grams for a certain k is reduced, then the number of k+1-gram concepts can only increase in number.</p><p>OBSERVATION 4. If all other thresholds are fixed, and only the support threshold of k-grams for a certain k is changed, then only the number of k-1, k, k+1, . . .-gram candidate concepts can change.</p><p>We now state a theorem about the correctness of our concept extraction algorithm. Intuitively, the theorem states that if only the concepts in the k-gram set satisfy the indicators in Sec. 2.5, then Algorithm conceptExtraction will extract precisely the concepts. THEOREM 1 (CORRECTNESS). Suppose we are provided with a dataset of k-grams, k = 1 . . . r, such that c1, c2, . . . , cn are concepts and s1, s2, . . . , sm are not concepts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>We only describe our experimental analysis on the AOL query log <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. Appendix F contains details of our experiments on the Google KGram <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> and the del.icio.us Tag Dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> (also outlined in Sec. 5).</p><p>We do not evaluate our program on the time taken for extraction. This is because, in practice, the algorithm is not required to respond on a real-time basis; and can be used to enrich the back-end concept set whenever there is a new dataset available, for example, the day's query log. But we also note that the program took less than half an hour to run on the AOL query log dataset on a laptop running Ubuntu on Intel Centrino Pro 1.60 GHz, and is therefore reasonably fast. We also note that extraction of concepts of a certain size k can happen in parallel, thus the algorithm is parallelizable.</p><p>The goal of our experiments is to study how well our algorithm performs in terms of "precision" and "recall" on varying various parameters, and in comparison with other algorithms. Precision is measured by seeing how many of the concepts returned by the algorithm are actually concepts. We make use of Mechanical Turk <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, a human evaluation engine, and the Wikipedia concept list for this purpose. However, we cannot compute recall precisely since we do not know how many concepts exist in the world at any point of time. Instead, we use the number of concepts returned by our algorithm as a measure of recall. We call this quantity the volume.</p><p>We first describe the results of our algorithm on the AOL query log data set. We then compare our results to two other algorithms when extracting the same number of concepts (i.e., same volume). Then, we study the precision of our algorithm when compared to other algorithms when we vary the volume of concepts extracted.</p><p>We also study the performance of our algorithm on changing various thresholds. Finally, we study how our algorithm performs on changing the size of the input dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>For the algorithms, we set the thresholds empirically using a small random sample of 30 k-grams for each k. We then used the thresholds to extract a certain number of concept k-grams. Some of these k-grams were already present in Wikipedia, and are therefore correct concepts. For the remaining k-grams, to rate them against human intuition, we evaluated each independently by 3 unknown reviewers on Mechanical Turk <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>. The reviewers were given the definition of concepts as in Sec. 2.1 and asked to identify k-grams that are concepts. The reviewers were also provided the search results from a popular search engine for the k-gram (thus helping reviewers judge concepts that they were not familiar with). We took the majority of the opinions of the reviewers -if two or more (out of 3) reviewers said that a k-gram is not a concept, we assumed that it is not a concept. We used these results to evaluate the algorithms on how precise the returned concepts are -measured in terms of absolute precision, i.e., (total 'correct' concepts/total concepts) and non-wiki precision, i.e., (total 'correct' non-Wikipedia concepts/total non-Wikipedia concepts). Non-wiki precision is also important because we already have the list of Wikipedia concepts at our disposal, and we would like to know how well the algorithms extract new concepts not found in Wikipedia.</p><p>Later on, when we evaluate the performance on varying parameters, we measure precision using the number of Wikipedia concepts extracted, i.e., precision is (total wikipedia concepts/total concepts). This makes it easier to evaluate our results automatically (for several result sets) and is a lower-bound on actual precision of our algorithm. Note that we did not use NLP as a filtering technique for any of the algorithms, given that the query log data-set is a refined data source, devoid of auxiliary words (which are necessary to make it a grammatically correct sentence). We did, however, use a simple stop word pruner which removes all concepts that begin with words such as 'who','that' and 'of'. for all the three algorithms, as described in Sec. 2.6.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Parameter k = 1 k = 2 k = 3 k = 4 support-threshold 100 35 60 60 min-conf-threshold -0.035 0.1 0.15 rel-conf-threshold - - 0.2 0.25 post-conf-threshold - 0.1 0.15 0.2 pre-conf-threshold - 0.1 0.15 0.2 dominance-thres - 1.3 1.3 1.3</formula><p>Note that we do not evaluate 1-grams because all of them are likely to be concepts (if we eliminate stop-words).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>(1)We ran our experiments on the AOL query log data set, which contains 36M queries from different users, and 1.5M unique terms. With parameters as listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>, a total of 25882 concepts were extracted by our algorithm, as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>, with an absolute precision of 0.95 rated against Wikipedia and Mechanical Turk. The thresholds in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> were used to extract 25882 concepts. Out of these, 21711 concepts were already present in Wikipedia. The statistics are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>. The first column describes the total statistics for 2,3 and 4-grams, while the subsequent columns give the breakup independently for 2, 3 and 4-grams, and then 1-grams. The first row gives the total number of concepts extracted by the algorithm, the second the number of Wikipedia concepts found in the concepts obtained in the first row. The third row gives the number of unevaluated concepts (i.e., those that are not Wikipedia concepts). The fourth row gives the number of concepts from the previous row found correct by the Mechanical Turk reviewers. The next two rows give the absolute precision (total 'correct' concepts/total concepts) and the precision on excluding concepts found in Wikipedia ((total 'correct' concepts -Wikipedia concepts)/(total concepts -Wikipedia concepts)). As is clear from the first column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>, out of the 2303 unevaluated 2-, 3-and 4-grams, 1934 were found to be concepts by the reviewers. The absolute precision for extraction of 2-,3-and 4-grams is (1934 + 4741)/(2303 + 4741) = 0.95. If we exclude Wikipedia concepts, the precision is 0.84 (for 2-,3-and 4-grams). The mistakes made by our algorithm are 369 for 2-,3-and 4-grams out of a total of 7044 concepts. Note that the precision for each k is high as well.  Here are examples of extracted concepts not in Wikipedia (and verified by Mechanical Turk):"Who's On My Page" (a Myspace plugin), "Shih tzu puppies" (puppies of a certain breed), "Oriental trading company", "Weichert real estate", etc. Examples of extracted concepts rejected by Mechanical Turk include: "Find out if someone", "Whats left of me", "Sunshine of the spotless" (subconcept), "Get rid of ants".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantity</head><p>(2)Comparison with two other strategies (naive and C-Value) for the same volume of 2,3 and 4-grams (7000): our algorithm gave fewer errors (369) as compared to the Naive algorithm (997) and C-Value algorithm (557). Also, the absolute precision for our algorithm was 0.95, when compared to 0.86 for the Naive algorithm and 0.92 for the C-Value algorithm. The non-wikipedia precision was 0.84 for our algorithm, as compared to 0.66 for the Naive algorithm and 0.75 for the C-value algorithm.  To examine how a naive approach would work as compared to Algorithm 1, we implemented a concept extraction procedure that selects concepts based simply on the frequency of occurrence of the k-gram. We tuned the frequency thresholds to achieve high precision (on a random set of 30 k-grams) and ensure that approximately the same total number of 2-gram, 3-gram and 4-gram concepts were extracted. The results are in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>. The extracted concepts were evaluated by reviewers on Mechanical Turk. The fraction of non-Wikipedia k-grams found to be concepts by Mechanical Turk is less: 1942/2939 = 0.67. By comparison, the precision for our algorithm for non-Wikipedia concepts is 1934/2303 = 0.84. Overall the mistakes made (ignoring 1-grams), is 2939 − 1942 = 997, almost 2.7 times the number of mistakes made by our algorithm (369) for the same number of concepts.  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: C-Value Algorithm. To contrast our algorithm to a term recognition strategy that also uses frequency information as a metric, we picked the C-Value Method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, and the results are in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. The method does not extract 1-gram concepts. The threshold was set so that a similar total number of k-grams were extracted (sum of 2-, 3-and 4-grams) as concepts as in our algorithm above. The fraction of non-Wikipedia k-grams found by the algorithm were 1682/2239 = 0.75, marginally better than the naive algorithm given above. The number of mistakes made in total were 2239-1682=557, 1.5 times the number of mistakes made in our algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantity</head><p>The poor results of the C-Value Algorithm are probably because the rules used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> are geared towards term recognition, and fail to recognize some Wikipedia-like concepts. Additionally, while our algorithm allows k-gram frequencies to affect whether k-ngrams and k+n-grams are extracted as concepts, the C-Value algorithm has a single top-down strategy, with k+n-grams affecting k-grams. Our algorithm, being based on statistics of Wikipedia concepts, reflecting true concepts, is therefore more sophisticated.  (3)Variation of precision versus volume of concepts extracted using a scatterplot for the C-Value algorithm and our algorithm: Our algorithm gets better precision for all volumes. Note that the performance of our algorithm and the C-Value algorithm may vary as the total number of k-grams extracted as concepts changes. To check this variation, we plotted the precision (measured using the number of Wikipedia concepts) of each of the two algorithms versus the volume of concepts extracted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>. Each point plotted on the figure corresponds to execution of one of the two algorithms with various threshold values, for instance, there is an execution of the C-Value algorithm that extracts around 15000 concepts and has a precision of 0.6, while there is a setting of threshold parameters for our algorithm which extracts the same number of concepts, but has a precision of around 0.64. It is clear from the figure that we can achieve higher precision for our algorithm than for the C-value algorithm for any number of concepts extracted. So for any value of the volume of concepts required, we can adjust threshold values in order to extract more precise concepts with our algorithm. This plot also demonstrates that setting the thresholds is relatively easy in our algorithm, because the data points in the scatter-plot were obtained by setting threshold values at 10 different starting configurations, and varying one threshold while keeping the rest fixed. Now that we have established that our algorithm gives us more flexibility in getting more concepts for a fixed precision, we now try to study how the various thresholds and the size of the query log affect the precision and volume of concepts extracted for our conceptExtraction algorithm.</p><p>(4)For our algorithm, Precision-Volume Tradeoff On Varying Support Threshold: Precision increases as Volume decreases on increasing support threshold. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(a)</ref> we kept all other thresholds constant and varied the 2-gram support threshold and examined the number of 2-gram concepts extracted and the precision of those 2-gram concepts. We repeated the experiment for two values of the support threshold of the 3-grams, for 20 and for 30. As expected, the volume of 2-grams extracted reduces as the support threshold increases. Also, the precision increases as the threshold increases since the concepts extracted with a high threshold are likely to be correct. Note that the graph for volume with a lower support threshold for 3-grams is below the graph with the higher support threshold. Similarly, the graph for the precision for the lower support threshold for 3-grams is above that for the higher one. This effect is because of Obsvn. 2.</p><p>(5)For our algorithm, Dependence of Volume (for various k) on Post-conf / Pre-conf / Min-conf Threshold: Thresholds for each k can be tuned independently of the others. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(b) and 1(c) depicts the variation of the number of various k-gram concepts with 3-gram pre-/post-conf threshold for fixed values of other parameters. The 3-grams are directly affected, and the graph falls sharply as the pre-/post-conf threshold is increased. The number of 2-gram concepts increases slightly because the number of 3-gram concepts has fallen, and the 2-gram concepts are less likely to be 'overridden' by a smaller number of 3-gram concepts. The number of 4-gram concepts, on the other hand, decreases slightly. This decrease is because the number of 3-gram candidate concepts has reduced in number, and by the second and third case of Algorithm 2, this would screen out more 4-gram concepts (since the 3-gram concepts would not pass the check). Note that the number of 2-gram and 4-gram concepts increase or decrease only slightly. Therefore, in practice, we can tune the pre/postconf parameter independently for each k.</p><p>We repeated the experiment on varying the min-conf threshold and found similar behavior (i.e., that one could tune min-conf independently for each k). These figures can be found in Appendix E.</p><p>(6)For our algorithm, Volume-Precision tradeoff with differing size of query log: Precision increases as Volume increases with increasing size of query log: Details are given in Appendix E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setting the Thresholds</head><p>The performance of conceptExtraction hinges on whether or not the thresholds are set appropriately. In the experiments above we manually tuned the parameters to obtain good results. In this paper, we focus on using the metrics rather than on finding the optimal thresholds.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we briefly discuss work closely related to ours; additional work is surveyed in Appendix H.</p><p>Our work is closely related to the field of association rule mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>, also called the market baskets problem. There are two steps to the solution of this problem: (a) extracting sets of items with sufficient support (b) finding out whether the items actually depend on each other. Agrawal et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref> only deals with the first step, noting that the second step is straightforward in the item-sets case.</p><p>Our problem is related in the sense that our goal is to extract concepts that are groups of words that occur more together than with other words. We use metrics similar to the support and confidence metrics. But the ordering of the words imposes additional restrictions on our problem. Also, we wish to extract the "best" concept, and delete some sub-concepts and super-concepts. In our case, the downward-closure property does not hold. Also unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>, we focus on the equivalent of the second step of the market baskets problem, given that we know the frequencies of all k-grams that are above a certain small threshold. The A-priori method may be used to determine 'frequent' word-sequences that have minimum support (the smallest support threshold over all k), i.e., step (a) above.</p><p>Term Recognition or Terminology Extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref>] is a well studied problem in the field of Information Extraction. Superficially, the aim is similar: that of extracting the most meaningful and concise k-grams, i.e., terms from a document. These terms aid in indexing for textbooks, creation of thesauri, etc. However, we wish to extract popular terms, i.e., concepts, and our metrics are tuned towards extracting high precision concepts. Also, since our aim is to extract concepts that are Wikipedia-like, our algorithm has been selected in order to make use of Claim 1 (which is based on statistics of Wikipedia concepts).</p><p>The statistical metrics used for term extraction include Mutual Information, log likelihood, cost criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25]</ref> etc. For example, Mutual Information is a single quantity which measures the probability of two terms occurring together as against independently. This measure is similar to our metrics of pre-and post-conf. However, the term extraction metrics suffer due to the fact that they give an absolute score to a k-gram, which is not sufficient when we are concerned about extraction of concepts that are "good" relative to super-and sub-concepts. Claim. 1 illustrates why we need both pre-and post-conf independently when looking for concepts. Also note that Mutual Information and the log likelihood measure would rank highly for a 'term' that has not been seen before in the dataset (and is therefore not popular). The cost criteria metric does not allow a concept to be part of a larger concept. It therefore does not apply for our purpose (see Sec. 2.3). However, we found that the C-Value metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> incorporates frequency information in such a way that could be used to extract popular terms using a top-down scheme. But in our analysis in Sec. 3 we find that the C-Value metric does not perform as well as our algorithm in extracting concepts from data sources that are 'dense' in concepts.</p><p>We could also consider semantic methods: the extraction of concepts from text based on semantic relationships, stemming, part-ofspeech tagging and other natural language processing tools. While our statistical approach can also be adapted seamlessly to free text (with the help of an NLP parser in containsStopWords), a semantic approach of determining concepts from text would not work in the case of query logs or tags. Thus the standard linguistic techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27]</ref> used in term extraction are not applicable.</p><p>We also draw from prior work on semantic relationship graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>, relationship discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, bootstrap methods for retrieving items and patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">5]</ref>, language models &amp; named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, automatic discovery of compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> and sequence mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we considered the problem of extracting concepts from a large set of k-grams annotated with frequencies. We demonstrated that it is necessary to look at not just the frequency of the kgram concerned, but also at the k-1-gram and k+1-gram frequencies when determining if a k-gram is a concept. We defined metrics to capture the indicators that we expect concepts to possess. We designed a one-pass algorithm to extract concepts using these metrics and showed that the algorithm is correct and possesses some desirable properties. We performed experimental analysis on the AOL dataset, measuring the volume-precision tradeoff on varying various parameters. The results were compared with those of a naive algorithm and a term recognition algorithm, displaying that our algorithm performs better than other techniques for the problem of concept extraction from large datasets. We also provided some intuition as to how thresholds may be tuned to get high precision and volume on a new dataset.</p><p>The experiments were also carried out on the Google k-gram data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> (k-grams extracted from web-pages along with their frequency), and the del.icio.us tag data set for one year. The Google k-gram dataset required an extensive POS tagger and evaluator to remove free text context and spam from the k-grams representing portions of concepts, but extracted as many as 0.25M concepts. The tag dataset gave rise to around 21500 concepts for the same thresholds in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. However, most of the concepts were 1-grams, indicating that users tend to use short concepts to label URLs. Additionally, the precision values were less for the two datasets. For example, for the tag dataset, while 1-grams had a precision lower-bound of 0.85, 2-grams had 0.6 precision.</p><p>There are several avenues for future work in extracting useful information from query logs. Once concepts have been identified, the web query logs could prove to be helpful not only in finding metadata about concepts (for example, the search query "Red bull taurine" might help us identify that the "Red bull" energy drink contains taurine), but also finding relationships between concepts (for example, "Martin Scorcese" and "The Departed" are likely to appear together in many search queries). In particular, if our web of concepts is arranged as a taxonomy (as in Wikipedia), then we can use cues from search queries that the concept is present in to find the "nearest" parent of a concept, or examine queries similar to the one the concept is in to find siblings. We can then add our concept to the taxonomy at its appropriate location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX</head><p>In the appendix, we give details for several items that were not considered in the main body of the paper, including</p><p>• Justification for evaluating sub-concepts in Appendix A </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. JUSTIFICATION FOR APPROACH</head><p>In this section, we provide justification for why our technique of evaluating bottom up, and comparing k-grams with sub-concepts is sufficient in order to evaluate the second indicator given in Sec. 2.5. We provide this justification by proving the correctness of our approach while making some assumptions.</p><p>Given a dataset, we will define concepts to be all the k-grams in the data set that are "better" than k-1-grams (sub-concepts) and k+1-grams (super-concepts). Thus, all k-grams in our setting have sufficient support to be a concept, and do not contain portions of sentences (i.e., they satisfy both the first and the third indicator). Therefore, all 1-grams are concepts.</p><p>Let c be a k-gram (k &gt; 2). Let b1 and b2 be the two k-1-grams that c contains, and d1, d2, . . ., dm be all the k+1-grams that contain c. Let function take two word sequences and return either true or false. (Intuitively, a b says that a is a "better concept" than b.) We define c to be a concept iff • c b1 or c b2 (i.e., c is better than sub-concepts) AND • ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , m} it is not true that di c (i.e., c is better than super-concepts)</p><p>For 2-gram concepts, only the second item is true. (Recall that Claim 1 states that 2-gram concepts can contain two 1-gram concepts.) We now suggest a bottom-up procedure that at every iteration evaluates k-grams relative to k-1-grams. Consider the following procedure Simple:</p><p>• 0: Let set S contain all 1-grams and 2-grams</p><p>• 1: For k from 3 to m</p><p>• 2: For all k-grams: (Let c be a k-gram, containing two k-1-grams b1 and b2.) • 3: If c b1, add c to S, remove b1 from S.</p><p>• 4: If c b2, add c to S, remove b2 from S.</p><p>We now prove that Simple extracts precisely the concepts from the dataset.</p><p>THEOREM 2 (CORRECTNESS OF SIMPLE). If we define concepts as given above, at the end of iteration k, the i-grams (∀i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1) still present in S are precisely the concept i-grams.</p><p>PROOF. We use an induction argument. First, note that the theorem is trivially true at the end of iteration 1 and iteration 2. Consider the end of iteration 3. We first prove that all 2-gram concepts a are in S. Since a is a concept, there exists no 3-gram c that contains a such that c a. Therefore, the condition in line 3 and 4 would never be true, and a is never removed from S. We also need to prove that no extraneous 2-grams are in S. If the 2-gram a is not a concept, then there is a c in the 3-gram set for which c a, in which case a would be removed from S. Now let us assume that the theorem holds at the end of iteration m, we wish to prove that it holds at the end of iteration m+1. By the induction hypothesis, all 1, 2, . . . , m-1-grams still in S are precisely the concepts among the 1, 2, . . . , m-1-grams. Now we need to prove the same for m-grams. We first prove that all m-gram concepts a are in S. Since a is a concept, (i) there is a m-1-gram b that a contains such that a b (ii) there exists no m+1-gram c that contains a such that c a. Due to (i), a is added to S in iteration m via line 3 or 4. Additionally, due to (ii), at iteration m+1, the condition in line 3 and 4 never evaluates to true, and a is never removed from S. On the other hand, if a is not a concept, then either a was not added to S at iteration m, or there is a c for which c a, in which case a would be removed from S at iteration m+1. Thus, at the end of iteration m+1, the 1, 2, . . . , m-grams still in S are precisely the concepts among the 1, 2, . . . , m-grams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. ALGORITHMIC DETAILS</head><p>In this section, we provide additional details for procedures candidateConceptCheck and containsStopWords from Sec. 2.6 that we did not cover in the main body of the paper due to space constraints.</p><p>As per the procedure candidateConceptCheck, a k-gram (k &gt; 2) is a candidate concept if it falls into one of three cases. These three cases (lines 8 − 13, 14 − 17, 18 − 21 in Algorithm 2) correspond to various values of pre-conf and the post-conf of the candidate concept. Either the candidate concept on the whole is "good" (case 1) or is formed by attaching words to the beginning or end of "good" concepts (case 2/3). The first case <ref type="bibr">(8 − 13)</ref> corresponds to both pre-and post-conf being very close to 1. This case corresponds to the case when neither of the k-1-grams are extracted as concepts. The second case (14-17) corresponds to the post-conf very close to 1, and the pre-conf small. This corresponds to the case where the prefix k-1-gram is extracted as a concept. The third case is symmetric to the second case (replacing b with c, pre-with post-, and so on) and we do not discuss it further.</p><p>In the first case, the k-gram is evaluated using two checks: the first of which says the least amount of confidence that we have in the candidate concept (i.e., the min-conf ) should surpass some threshold (which is a function of k). The second check says that the k-gram should be "better" than its sub-concepts -defined by the fact that rel-conf surpasses a threshold. If a k-gram passes these two checks, then we are better off keeping the given k-gram in our set of extracted concepts than any of the 2 sub-concepts; and thus we discard both the sub-concepts. Consider, for example, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', which has a high min-conf and a high relconf. We discard 'Who Framed Roger' and 'Framed Roger Rabbit', and retain 'Who framed Roger Rabbit'.</p><p>The second case involves concepts of the form &lt;name&gt; &lt;topic&gt;, where topic refers to a concept that forms a kind of 'category' (example: Intel / Microsoft Research Labs) or &lt;topic&gt; &lt;name&gt; (example: Home Alone I/II/III (These are children's movies.)). Here, the pre-conf is likely to be much higher than the post-conf (in the algorithm, we would want pre-conf to be &gt; post-conf × dominance-thres, where dominance-thres &gt; 1) -because the &lt;name&gt; field can be changed. We also expect the pre-conf to be very close to 1. Since the pre-conf is very high, we can effectively discard the prefix k-gram and keep the k-gram as a candidate concept. However, we retain the suffix, because that could still be extracted as a concept. The suffix must already be a candidate concept, since it has been examined before. &lt;topic&gt; &lt;name&gt; is dealt with in the same way. These cases are reflected in the algorithm.</p><p>Now, a few remarks about the containsStopWords procedure.</p><p>While the containsStopWords check may eliminate some actual concepts, we prefer to have higher precision (which is the case when we discard k-grams of the above form) rather than higher recall (more concepts, including those with stop-words). The trade-off is strongly in favor of precision, because the loss in precision is drastic if we allow k-grams of the above kind to be concepts. Not having this check essentially allows portions of sentences to be concepts simply because the words involved occur often togetheryet may not represent a real-world entity.</p><p>Note that we only run the containsStopWords check (and prune candidate concepts that do not pass the check) after the first phase of extraction (lines 2-10 of conceptExtraction). This is because the candidate concepts could still be part of a larger concept, and may be required for correct screening of the larger concepts. However, we could pass the candidate concept set of size until k through to the containsStopWords check when we have moved to the processing of the k+2-grams in the first phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. COMPLEXITY DETAILS</head><p>If we sort the k-gram set lexicographically, searching is O(log n). Per k-gram, we do a lookup of the frequencies of two k-1-grams and three k-2-grams, which amounts to 5 lookups. In addition, we may need to check if the two k-1 grams are candidate concepts in the candidate concept set (or discard them), which may incur an additional O(log n) each. Thus the worst case number of lookups that we may need to perform per concept are 7 log n, and the overall complexity of the one-pass algorithm is O(n log n). Our performance can drastically improve if we use hashing to do the lookups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. PROOFS</head><p>In this section, we give proofs for the results listed in Sec. 2.7.</p><p>PROOF OF OBSERVATION 1. Whether or not a k-gram is added as a candidate concept depends on the set of k-1-grams. As per algorithm 1, we do not discard the k-1-grams that get 'overridden' until we are done processing all the k-grams. Thus the order of processing of the k-grams is unimportant. PROOF OF OBSERVATION 2. Lower the k-gram support threshold, more the number of k-gram candidate concepts will pass the support condition, and the number of k-1-grams that get overridden and discarded will increase (because they are sub-concepts of the new k-gram candidate concepts). The k-1-grams that remain are only the exceptionally good ones (implying an increase in precision). Hence the result. PROOF OF OBSERVATION 3. Lower the k-gram support threshold, more the number of k-gram sub-concepts, more the number of k+1-gram candidate concepts that will be under consideration via lines 14-21, and more of them will get accepted as concepts. Hence the result.</p><p>PROOF OF OBSERVATION 4. When we are analyzing k-grams, the k-2-gram candidate concept set (and below) has already been fixed, and hence cannot be changed. k-1-grams are affected because they may be discarded. k+1-grams are affected because the k-gram set is consulted to see if a k+1-gram is a candidate concept or not. Similarly, k+2-grams are affected because the k+1-gram set is consulted to see if a k+2-gram is a candidate concept or not, and so on.</p><p>Note that in the theorem of correctness, whose proof we give below, we do not need to specify the frequency of concepts relative to sub-concepts, just relative to the context (i.e., the k+1-grams that the k-gram appears in). PROOF OF THEOREM 1. Consider rel-conf-threshold to be 0 for all k. Let min-conf-threshold(k) = post/pre-conf-threshold(k) = 1/g(k). Let the support-threshold = f (k). We let dominancethres be 1. We also let the containsStopWords check returns false for all k-grams, since we can make out if a k-gram is a concept or not by looking at just the statistical properties. We use induction for the proof. We start with k = 1, and argue that the conceptExtraction algorithm precisely outputs the concepts and discards the non-concepts.</p><p>For k = 1, as per the algorithm, if the support threshold is met, it is a concept, else not. This set is the same as the 1-gram concept set matching the specification above. Since none of the 1-grams are discarded (while analyzing 2-grams) in the algorithm, the same 1-grams are output as concepts.</p><p>Now consider analysis of k-grams (k ≥ 2) by the algorithm. By the end of this phase, the k-1-gram concept set will no longer be modified, so we analyze the k-1-grams that are output as concepts. We assume, as the induction hypothesis, that all up-to k-2-gram concepts have been correctly extracted.</p><p>If a k-1-gram a is a concept, then we prove the following:</p><p>• It is not discarded at the k-1-gram stage • It is not discarded at the k-gram stage</p><p>At the k-1-gram stage, the k-1-gram passes the support threshold, either contains one k-2-gram that is a concept, or no k-2-grams that are concepts (from Claim 1). In the first case, the candidateConceptCheck procedure proceeds to lines 14-17 (or 18-21, equivalently). The prefix k-2-gram is a candidate concept, the post-conf &gt; the pre-conf (since the threshold is 1) -because the concept k-2-gram occurs more frequently than g(k − 1) × Sa, while the other k-2-gram occurs less frequently than g(k−1)×Sa. Also, the postconf is greater than the threshold 1/g(k − 1). Thus a will not be discarded at the k-1-gram stage. In the second case, no k-2-gram is a candidate concept. In this case the min-conf will be greater than threshold 1/g(k − 1), and hence a will not be discarded.</p><p>At the k-gram stage, any k-gram b that the k-1-gram concept a appears in has a pre/post-conf (as the case may be) of S b /Sa, which is definitely less than 1/g(k), and hence the k-1-gram is not discarded.</p><p>Thus all the concepts are definitely not discarded. If a k-1-gram is not a concept and is not contained in any kgram, then it does not pass the support threshold, and hence is discarded by the algorithm. If the k-1-gram is not a concept but is contained in some k-gram, then:</p><p>• Either it does not pass the support threshold (in which case the algorithm discards it at the k-1-gram phase), • Or, the algorithm accepts the k-1-gram in the k-1-gram phase.</p><p>But the frequency of the k-1-gram is smaller than g(k) × R, where R is the smallest frequency of all k-grams containing the k-1-gram having frequency &gt; f (k). In this case, one of two things can happen for any given k-gram b (with frequency &gt; f (k) -since only those k-grams can pass the support threshold): -The other k-1-gram contained in b is also a non-concept -The other k-1-gram contained in b is a concept In the first sub-case, the two k-1-grams in b give rise to a minconf for b &gt; 1/g(k), thus the algorithm (correctly) discards both the k-1-grams (lines 8-13). In the second case, we look at lines 14-17 or 18-21. Let us assume that the second k-1-gram (the one that is a concept) is a prefix k-1-gram. In this case the k-gram has a high post-confidence &gt; 1/g(k) (higher than the pre-confidence, which is &lt; 1/g(k)), and the non-concept k-1-gram is discarded.</p><p>Thus all the non-concepts are definitely discarded by the algorithm either at the k-1-gram phase or the k-gram phase.</p><p>Hence the algorithm correctly extracts the concepts and discards the non-concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. QUERY LOG EXPERIMENTS (CONTD.)</head><p>We now describe in detail additional experiments that we performed on the AOL query log set.</p><p>(5)For our algorithm, Dependence of Volume (for various k) on Min-conf Threshold: Thresholds for each k can be tuned independently of the others. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(a) is identical to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1(b)</ref> and 1(c) except that we vary the min-conf thresholds. This figure shows that we can tune the min-conf thresholds independently for each k. We changed the 4-gram min-conf threshold and plotted the results on the same graph. Also note that while the number of 2-gram concepts do not change on changing the 4-gram threshold, the number of 4-gram concepts reduce on increasing the threshold, and 3-gram concepts increase, as expected. Thus the min-conf thresholds can be tuned independently as well.</p><p>(6)For our algorithm, Volume-Precision Tradeoff with differing size of query log: Precision Increases as Volume Increases with increasing size of query log.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(b) and 3(c) we ran the algorithm (having fixed the thresholds) on segments of the query log of increasing size for 3-and 4-grams respectively. We found that while the number of concepts (i.e., the volume) increased as the query log size increased (because more and more k-grams cross the thresholds), the precision does not increase after a point, because all the Wikipedia concepts have been found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We now briefly outline our experiments on the Delicious tag dataset and the Google K-gram dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F.1 Experiments on Web KGrams (Summary)</head><p>In addition to looking at the AOL query logs, we also ran our algorithm on Google's Web KGram Data Set <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. KGrams from the web are more prone to spam and errors from portions of sentences in free text and thus special rules to eliminate such candidate concepts were required. A powerful POS tagger was used in our containsStopWords procedure to eliminate portions of sentences. After this, (and after eliminating those found in Wikipedia) around 0.05M 2-gram concepts and around 0.2M 3-gram concepts were extracted. The data set had around 300M 2-grams and around 900M 3-grams in total.</p><p>Since it is not feasible (both practically and monetarily) to evaluate all the concepts extracted by our algorithm, we instead evaluated a random sample of concepts, wherein the accuracy was found to be around 70%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F.2 Experiments on Tag Dataset (Summary)</head><p>User submitted tags for delicious (http://del.icio.us) are another useful source for k-grams. We repeated our experiment on the Delicious Dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, for the period from June 2007 to March 2008. Similar thresholds were used as in Sec. 2. The experiment extracted 20302 1-gram concepts, with 85% found in Wikipedia. But the 2-, 3-and 4-gram concepts extracted were fewer: 396, 334 and 480 respectively. 60% of the 2-grams were Wikipedia topics, while 15% of the rest were Wikipedia topics. The reason that a smaller number of concepts were extrated is probably that the del.icio.us interface encourages users to type in all the tags for a URL together on one line, not separated by punctuation. Hence the smaller concepts are harder to extract when placed next to other frequently occurring concepts.</p><p>Clearly, tagging sets are less useful than query logs for long concepts because people tend to tag items with as few 'disjoint' words as possible. Most useful tags are therefore, 1-grams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. SETTING THE THRESHOLDS</head><p>The thresholds that we use in our algorithm candidateConceptCheck needs to be tuned inorder to extract concepts with a high level of precision. To select good thresholds, one can use the following techniques:</p><p>•Machine Learning Approach: We could use machine classification to 'learn' optimal thresholds for the candidateConceptCheck algorithm, in order to be able to classify better what is a concept and what is not. In our case, the problem is that of learning from positive and unlabeled examples (also called PU-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>). The positive examples include k-grams that we know to be concepts from sources such as Wikipedia article titles and encyclopedias. The machine learning algorithm should try to extract or approximate a set of reliable negative training examples and then apply a classification algorithm to approximate the optimal thresholds. We plan to explore this direction in subsequent work.</p><p>•Manual Tuning Approach: We can also tune the thresholds manually. On a new dataset, we could do the following: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures  1(b)</ref> 1(c) and 3(a) indicate that parameters may be tuned separately, independent of each other. Thus we could fix all parameters at some starting value, change thresholds for one k, note the response (either by looking at the Wikipedia set, or by random sampling and evaluation). We then use that as the starting point for tuning thresholds for the next k. We set all thresholds in this manner in increasing order of k. However, note that the threshold dominancethreshold will need to be tuned globally.</p><p>For a given k, to set the pre-/post-conf, rel-conf, min-conf and support thresholds, we do the following: Assume that d% of the kgrams are concepts (We can quickly determine the value d by looking at a random sample of the k-grams). Set the support threshold to the value such that for a random sample of the log, (d + ∆)% of that sample has frequency above this value. Then consider all the k-gram Wikipedia concepts that are above the support threshold, and choose the smallest values for the pre-/post-conf, rel-conf and min-conf thresholds such that the same Wikipedia concepts are selected as concepts. For those Wikipedia concepts that have sub-concepts (since we have tuned the k-1-gram thresholds beforehand), depending on the ratio r = pre-conf/post-conf, we select thresholds such that the Wikipedia concepts pass the check in line 8 (if r ≈ dominance-threshold), line 14 (r is smaller) or 18 (r is larger) in Algorithm 2. We retain one of the k-1-grams as subconcepts if r or 1/r &gt; dominance-threshold. Else we discard both k-1-grams.</p><p>We note that a lower min-conf threshold needs to be accorded to the 2-grams relative to the 3-grams because a given word may be followed by many other words giving rise to a number of concepts. Basically, seeing the 1-gram gives you less indication as to what the 2-gram might be.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. ADDITIONAL RELATED WORK</head><p>We now describe in detail some other prior work which is not as closely related as those in Sec. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref>, and details for some that were briefly outlined in Sec. 4.</p><p>[29] describes an approach to extract item-sets with length decreasing support-thresholds, which is true in our case (as k in- creases, the k-gram support threshold decreases), however, the algorithm involves use of the FP-tree method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, which cannot be immediately applied to find all k-grams (which are word sequences, not sets) with a support greater than some f (k), since the subset property does not hold. Adapting the FP-tree method for our purposes remains an open problem. Additionally, we focus on the second part of the frequent-itemset problem, i.e., how the confidence in an k-gram relative to other k -grams affects our choice of the k-gram as a concept.</p><p>[30] describes a method to mine confident association rules without a support requirement. While we could use this method to prune k-grams that we do not have sufficient confidence in, even this work is not immediately applicable to our case, because the universal-existence upward closure property as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> does not hold. Additionally we have multiple confidence metrics and values of thresholds for those metrics, as against one min-conf threshold in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Another related topic of research is sequence mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref> which deals with mining sequences of items to find items that occur one after the other in sequence, in order to isolate temporal dependencies between items, which is very different from our goal, which is to find sequence of words that form concepts, and the procedures used are vastly different.</p><p>Generating hierarchies from documents has been explored in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21]</ref>, however, these works are limited by the fact that they use natural language processing to extract terms from grammatically correct sentences, and therefore cannot be applied to generic datasets like tags and query logs.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>, the authors use SRGs (Semantic Relationship Graphs) to represent semantic relationships between words extracted from text. Popularity is not used as a criteria to extract these words. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13]</ref> deal with determining relationships, groupings etc. between terms extracted from text. We do not discuss relationships between concepts -or even the conditions of hypernymy or metronymy in this paper. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">5]</ref> talk of extracting items (and then relationships between those items) based on bootstrapping with pre-defined (or subsequently discovered) patterns appearing in text. We, on the other hand, do not have a seed set of patterns or items to begin with, and our domain is not restricted to select types, the set of book-author pairs or symptom-cause pairs, respectively in the two references above. Our approach is general and does not require grammatically correct sentences as input.</p><p>The problem of named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> has as its aim detection and identification of 'named entities' -cars, persons, institutions, dates etc. Recognition is done via part-of-speech tagging and other natural language processing techniques. While we extract concepts of all kinds, named entity recognition can detect and extract concepts of specific types. However, named entity recognition cannot be performed on data sets such as query logs and tag data.</p><p>Building association rules on text k-grams is not new; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> uses association rules between text k-grams and web pages that are clicked on for those k-grams.</p><p>Our work is also related to the field of word-level k-gram language modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>: the post-conf metric we use is nothing but the marginal probability of seeing the last word given the previous k-1 words. However, we measure both forward and backward probabilities, i.e., that of seeing the first word given the last k-1 words as well. Additionally, rel-conf metric has no counterpart in the language modeling field.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Variation of Number of 2-grams and their precision, vs. Support threshold for 2-grams.
