				<p>Although the ant metaphor has been successfully applied to routing of data packets both in wireless and fixed networks , little is yet known about its applicability to the task of query routing in peer-to-peer environments. This work presents SemAnt, an algorithm for distributed query routing based on the Ant Colony Optimization meta-heuristic. The experimental results show that the algorithm produces robust results and converges fast. Based on the results gained so far, the goal for the Ph.D. thesis is to extend the algorithm to include strategies for self-adaptation to volatile networks where nodes may leave or join at any time.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Ant algorithms are inspired by the collective foraging behavior of specific ant species which use a chemical substance called pheromone for indirect communication. Summarized by a meta-heuristic called Ant Colony Optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, several algorithms exist that model and exploit this behavior for solving graph-based NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, e.g., the traveling salesman problem. Similarities between the self-organizing behavior of ant colonies and self-organization in peer-to-peer networks have already been observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Since they do not require any global knowledge about the network, ant algorithms are qualified for peer-to-peer networks.</p><p>The research question to be answered in this thesis is: "To which extent are ant algorithms feasible for the task of content-based query routing in peer-to-peer networks?" In particular, one aspect that did not yet receive a lot of attention in the research community is that of the inherent dynamics of peer-to-peer networks: changes in the content repositories occur frequently, and peers can join or leave at any time (churn). The goal of the thesis is to deliver an algorithm that includes strategies to cope with these dynamics.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 1.1 introduces ant-based methods, with a focus on those for routing. Related work is described in Section 1.2. Section 2 specifies SemAnt, the proposed ant algorithm, and Section 3 shows experimental results indicating its performance. Section 4 presents plans for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Ant-based algorithms for routing</head><p>In ant algorithms, after initializing each edge of the problem graph with a small amount of pheromone and defining each ant's starting node, a small number of ants runs for a large number of iterations. For every iteration, each ant determines a path through the graph from its starting to its destination node by applying a so-called random proportional transition rule at each decision point. This rule decides, based on the specific edge's amount of pheromone and cost, which one of all possible next nodes to choose. When the ant arrives at the destination node, the total costs of the newly found solution are calculated. After all ants have found a solution, the pheromone trail update rule is applied for each edge which is part of the solution. The amount of newly dropped pheromone depends on the quality of the solution. Additionally, some pheromone evaporates in each iteration according to an evaporation factor.</p><p>A dedicated subset of ant-based algorithms was specifically designed for managing routing tables in IP networks. The most prominent variant of ant algorithms for routing is AntNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In AntNet, ants collaborate in building routing tables that adapt to current traffic in the network with the aim of optimizing the performance of the entire network. The network is mapped on a directed weighted graph with N nodes. Each node manages a routing table that stores information about the outgoing links and their amount of pheromone. The edges of the graph are the links between nodes and are viewed as bit pipes having a certain costbandwidth and transmission delay -that depends on the current load of this link. The routing tables are matrices of size N × l, where l is the number of outgoing links. At startup, all routing tables are initialized with a uniform distribution of all reachable nodes. At regular intervals, each node generates a so-called forward ant that builds a path to a randomly selected destination node by applying a transition rule at each node in order to decide -based on link costs and pheromone amounts -which outgoing link to follow. When a forward ant F sd launched at a source node N s has reached its destination node N d and calculates the total costs of the solution, it cannot update the pheromone trails directly. Since each node stores routing information locally, it has to generate a backward ant B ds that will return to node N s through the same path that was used by the forward ant. The backward ant is responsible for updating the pheromone trail according to the information gathered by the forward ant by altering the routing table of each visited node. The backward ants update all entries corresponding to destination node N d . For preventing cycles, each forward ant F sd manages a stack of nodes already visited. An evaporation feature is not included in the algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Related work</head><p>Since ant-based methods are not applicable to structured networks, the focus of the literature review lies on unstructured networks. It includes previous attempts to apply antbased methods to query routing in peer-to-peer networks.</p><p>Many approaches to query routing in unstructured peerto-peer networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> exist. The simplest technique is broadcasting, where a query is recursively forwarded to all reachable neighbor nodes. Since broadcasting consumes a high amount of resources, Yang and Garcia-Molina <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> were among the first to suggest that a peer should rely on statistical information about its neighbors -such as the number of results received in the past -together with simple heuristics to make an intelligent guess which one is the best to send a query to. Their approach considers only the first hop of each query, and uses broadcast for the other hops. Other methods consider all hops and try to predict based on a query's keywords which node is capable of answering it, again by exploiting locally indexed information about user queries in the past. Joseph and Hoshiai coin the term reputation learning for these techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The basic premise behind reputation learning, which was first published by Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, is that peers that would have been able to satisfy previous queries are more likely candidates to answer a current query which is similar. Another premise, namely interest-based locality <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is that peers which share a certain resource are more likely to be able to answer each other's queries because they have at least one common interest. For peer selection, functions that rank the information in the index according to its relevance to the query are used in order to select the node that is most likely to contain content that satisfies the query. The ranking functions are based on probabilistic models like in Infobeacons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, social metaphors like in REMINDIN' <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, or on information retrieval techniques like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The most comprehensive source of information about the applicability of biological processes to distributed environments is provided by Babaoglu et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, including a discussion of ant-based methods in context and an attempt to apply the biological process of proliferation to search in unstructured overlay networks. Anthill <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is a Javabased open source framework for the design, implementation, and evaluation of ant algorithms in peer-to-peer networks. Although for demonstration purposes Anthill was used to build a file-sharing application called Gnutant, the projects focuses on the development of the framework and not on the algorithm itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Description of the SemAnt algorithm</head><p>The application scenario for the algorithm is that of a distributed search engine where each peer (1) manages a repository of documents and offers its content to the other peers, and (2) each peer performs keyword-based searches based on meta-data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The network must be independently optimized for each possible keyword by employing multiple pheromone types <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. To restrict the maximum number of pheromone types, the document meta-data vocabulary is constrained to a controlled vocabulary, e.g, the concepts of a taxonomy or an ontology. Each document can be an instance of one or more concepts. A query Q can consist of one or more keywords c 1 , ..., c n . Multiple keywords are connected using the boolean operator OR. A document is an appropriate result for a given query Q if it is an instance of one of the concepts c 1 , ..., c n .</p><p>At each peer P i , pheromone trails are maintained in a table τ of size C × n, where C is the size of the controlled vocabulary and n is the number of peer P i 's outgoing links to neighbor peers P u where u ∈ {1, ..., n}. Each τ cu stores the amount of pheromone type c dropped at the link from peer P i to peer P u , for each concept c and each neighbor peer P u . At startup, all table entries are initialized with the same small value τ init .</p><p>SemAnt adopts the AntNet strategy of forward ants and backward ants for supporting distributed problems, and its strategy for preventing cycles. The difference is that -instead of sending out forward ants at regular intervals -we create a forward ant for each query that occurs in the network. This ant is responsible for answering the query. A time-to-live (TTL) parameter T max is used to prevent forward ants from running infinitely. If a forward ant arrives at a peer that stores documents satisfying the query, it creates a backward ant. Consequently, if a backward ant was created, it will arrive at the querying peer within a time interval of 2 * T max . If it does not, then there is no result for the query. After the first backward ant is created, there are two possibilities: Either the forward ant terminates its travel, or it continues it until the maximum TTL is reached. The idea behind the latter approach is that if forward ants are allowed to go on after they found the first result node, they can increase the absolute number of documents found by detecting other result nodes and generating multiple backward ants. For describing the implications of these two possibilities, we introduce the following metrics: Resource usage is defined as the number of links traveled for each query, and hit rate is defined as the number of documents found for each query. If the ants are terminated after they found the first result, the resource usage is minimized, but the hit rate increases only slightly. In the other case, where the ants use the maximum TTL, the hit rate is maximized, but the resource usage decreases only slightly. Our experiments show that terminating the forward ant after it has found the first result leads to a lower number of hops traveled for retrieving one document and thus increases the overall performance of the network. The reason for that is that if the the ants go on, they tend to stay in the neighborhood of the node they already found, since the pheromone trails indicate that there is an appropriate node nearby. Nevertheless, it is also reasonable to let the ants use the maximum TTL, because in this case the number of documents found for a single query is higher. This impact is of benefit for the individual users of the system.</p><p>As described above, AntNet natively accounts for different links costs in terms of a link's bandwidth and latency. This feature could be easily transferred to SemAnt. However, the difficulty lies in evaluating its usefulness. The yet unsolved problems are (1) to find adequate network test data that includes the cost of all links and (2) to find an appropriate method for comparison, since we are not aware of any other approach that takes link costs into account.</p><p>The ant algorithm's routing strategy is defined by its transition rule. An adapted version of Ant Colony System's transition rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is used. This rule consists of two strategies that complement each other. Based on probability w s , each forward ant F Q decides if it applies the exploiting or the exploring strategy. In the exploiting strategy, the link to the best neighbor peer P j with the highest quality is selected by applying the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">j = arg max u∈U ∧u / ∈S(F Q ) [τ cu ] ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where U is the set of neighbor peers of P i , and S(F Q ) is the set of peers already visited by F Q . The exploring strategy encourages the forward ants to discover new paths. In case F Q utilizes the exploring strategy, the transition rule shown in (2) and (3) is applied for each neighbor peer P j . The first step is to derive a goodness value p j for each neighbor peer P j not already visited. In the second step, an adapted version of the roulette wheel selection is applied technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for selecting peers: Each p j is separately placed on the continuum between 0 and 1, and for each p j a random value q is calculated for deciding whether P j should be selected. This strategy allows more than one peer to be selected to account for the fact that there are multiple possible destination peers which contain answers for a query. To ensure that at least one peer will be selected, SemAnt falls back to the exploiting strategy in case the exploring strategy does not to select any peer.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p j = τ cj u∈U ∧u / ∈S(F Q ) τ cu<label>(2)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">GOT O j = 1 if q ≤ p j ∧ j ∈ U ∧ j / ∈ S(F Q ) 0 else ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where q is a random value, q ∈ [0, 1], and p j = 1. In case of GOT O j = 1, F Q sends a clone of itself to peer P j .</p><p>If a forward ant arrives at a certain peer P D storing appropriate result documents D, it generates a backward ant and supplies it with D and with a copy of the stack that contains all visited peers S(F Q ). The backward ant calculates the sum of all entries in S(F Q ) to get the total number of hops T D for the path from the querying peer P Q to peer P D , and travels back hop-by-hop according to the information stored in S(F Q ) until it arrives at peer P Q . At each intermediate peer, the backward ant drops pheromone on the link previously selected by the forward ant. The pheromone update rule is adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and defined as shown in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> and (5). The amount of pheromone depends on the goodness of the path. The goodness is determined by comparing the number of documents found and the length of the path to optimal values. As shown in (5), the values for the optimal solution are set to 1 2 · T max for the path length and D opt for the number of documents. Parameter w d weights the influence of document quantities and path lengths.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">τ cj ← τ cj + Z,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Z = w d · |D| D opt + (1 − w d ) · T max 2 · T D<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Each peer applies the evaporation rule shown in (6) in a predefined interval t e for each link to neighbor peer P u and each concept c, where the amount of evaporating pheromone is controlled by parameter ρ ∈ [0, 1]. </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">τ cu ← (1 − ρ) · τ cu<label>(6)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Simulation and results</head><p>SemAnt is evaluated by simulating a peer-to-peer system with 1024 peers and by comparing its performance against that of the well-known k-random walker <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> approach. In this experiment, a static network topology and document distribution is assumed. The system supports cooperation between computer scientists by sharing documents. In order to choose a realistic model for social networks, a small world network <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> with a clustering coefficient of 2 is used. Content is modeled with the ACM Computing Classification System <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> taxonomy. Each document is an instance of a certain leaf concept. In total, ACM CCS contains 910 leaf concepts. To represent each research topic equally, we create the same number of documents for each leaf concept. We create 34 documents per concept and thus get 30940 documents in total. This is a rather small setup, but sufficient for our purposes. For the document distribution, a model similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is used. Each peer is an expert on a certain topic and therefore 60% of its documents are instances of one particular research area. 20% of its documents are related to another research area. The remaining documents are instances of random leaf concepts. Research areas are modeled by the third-level concepts of the taxonomy. The distribution of documents among the peers follows a bell curve with a mean of 29.6 and a standard deviation of 12.15. For uniform distribution of queries within the network, a ticker clock at each peer is used. The probability that a peer issues a query within one time unit is set to 0.1. A query consists of a randomly selected leaf concept.</p><p>The optimal values for the configurable parameters of SemAnt are mostly dependent on the network topology used and on the content distribution within the network. A first study of the impact of different content distributions on the overall performance of the system can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. It is planned to investigate this issue in more detail with the goal of finding a method for determining the optimal parameter settings at runtime. The experiments conducted so far revealed that resource usage is highly dependent on weight w s . The more ants employ the exploring strategy, the more traffic occurs in the network, but not necessarily leading to proportionally better hit rates. In the experiment described here, the best trade-off between resource usage and hit rate can be observed when setting parameter w s = 0.85. The other parameter values were chosen as follows: ρ = 0.07, T max = 25, D max = 10, w d = 0.5. To provide for comparison fairness, the time-to-live parameter of krandom walker is also set to 25, and k is set to 2. The metrics used for evaluation are resource usage defined as the number of links traveled for each query, and hit rate defined as the number of documents found for each query. In this experiment, the forward ants use the maximum TTL, thus maximizing hit rate (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). The results of the resource usage comparison between SemAnt and krandom walker are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. These numbers include both forward and backward ants/agents. The performance of k-random walker stays constant with on avg. 59.27 links traveled by the agents for finding on avg. 1.49 result documents. On the contrary, SemAnt increases its performance. The algorithm converges quite fast and reaches its optimal performance after 2000 time units. The hit rate increases to 3.95 documents per query, and resource usage decreases to 54.04 links traveled. From time unit 2000 to 10000, the hit rate stays nearly constant while the resource usage decreases slightly and declines to 53.02 links per query at time unit 10000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Future work</head><p>In the experimental evaluation described above, a static network topology and document distribution was assumed. In the next step, we want to evaluate and improve the performance of the algorithm in a dynamic setting in which new peers are joining the network, peers are leaving, and peers add or remove documents from their repositories. In these cases, it is necessary to adapt the pheromone trails in order to reflect these changes. To correct the amount of pheromone, the η-strategy proposed by Guntsch and Middendorf <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> will be investigated. According to this strategy, the closer a link is to a joining or leaving node, the higher the amount of pheromone which is removed from it. This increases the influence of new links, and thus encourages the ants to use the new paths. In the original η-strategy, the measurement of closeness is based on the link costs. We will test a simplified version and measure closeness in number of hops. Next to the η-strategy, other possibilities for bootstrapping the pheromone trails of newly joined peers are either to copy pheromone information from neighbor peers, or to create artificial queries at the newly joined peer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This paper proposed SemAnt, a novel algorithm based on the Ant Colony Optimization meta-heuristic designed for the task of query routing in peer-to-peer networks. In SemAnt, ants cooperate in creating pheromone trails -probabilistic overlay networks -that indicate the most promising path for a given query. The more popular a query, the better its trail is optimized. Our first experimental results show that the algorithm converges fast, and that its performance is acceptable with the great benefit of being stable and robust.</p><p>The vision for the Ph.D. thesis is to build a self-repairing network that can adjust itself to network churn. There are several reasons to be confident that our approach is suitable for the inherent dynamics of peer-to-peer network. First, the evaporation feature is built-in by nature and automatically helps to remove outdated trails. Second, since content is not replicated or relocated in our approach, it is comparatively easier to design a strategy for coping with churn. Third and finally, the pheromone trails build a global map of the content distribution in the network which can be adapted according to changes in network topology and content distribution.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
