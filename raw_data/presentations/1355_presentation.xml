    <p>Testbed experimentation takes a long time  Setup, running, analysis  Weeks to months</p>
    <p>Testbeds encourage release of resources if they are not actively used (idle swap, emails)</p>
    <p>Users need a way to preserve state  OS configuration  Applications installed and data  Solution: disk images</p>
    <p>Base and custom images</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Images use a lot of space  340 GB on Deterlab = 1/3 of shared storage</p>
    <p>Older images are not updated  Vulnerabilities  Swap-in problems</p>
    <p>Older images reduce experiments chance of swap in  Not supported on new hardware  testbeds and</p>
    <p>their user base grow  Users do not understand this limitation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Mined from DB/disk and usage logs  1,128 images</p>
    <p>645 in DB/disk (22% never used)  483 used and deleted</p>
    <p>47% projects and 14.4% allocations use custom images  48% of research projects = 735 images/77 projects  44% of class projects = 124 images/19 projects  47% allocations use images older than 1 year  Disk images are popular and numerous</p>

    <p>Goals:  reduce storage requirements  facilitate easier update/upgrade</p>
    <p>Catalogue and reapply image customizations at file level  DiffBase  DiffCustom  AppStore</p>
    <p>Help users script/reapply installations + store large data locally (dedicated disk/network)</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Compare custom image with base during crea4on, file by file  Store only differences  Added/modified files, list of deleted files, catalogue of sparse files and their contents</p>
    <p>Saves 75% disk space  Larger images load faster!  Helps a liFle with OS update/upgrade</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Compare custom images within one project with each other  Store one using DiffBase  For others store file differences between each and that first custom image</p>
    <p>Saves 78% disk space  Helps as much as DiffBase with OS update/ upgrade</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page"/>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Run DiffBase approach  Automa4cally compare files iden4fied as added/ modified with applica4on packages</p>
    <p>For matches:  Remove them from DiffBase state  Store configura4on changes and package name</p>
    <p>Saves 81% disk space  Facilitates easy OS update/upgrade</p>

    <p>Testbed users need a way to save state  Disk images are not a good option</p>
    <p>Our proposed alternatives save significant amount of storage  But do little to help users update/upgrade images</p>
    <p>Future research  Help users catalogue changes they made to a</p>
    <p>base image and their purpose  Automate migration to other images / upgrade</p>
