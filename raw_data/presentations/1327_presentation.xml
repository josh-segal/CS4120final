    <p>Provenance can be used to determine how much to trust the data</p>
    <p>Provenance metadata is essential for data consumers to assess the authoritativeness and trustworthiness of the data asset  IA Metadata COI</p>

    <p>Provide a mechanism for calculating a trust value that does not require access to the data itself  Some data are not accessible from the provenance store</p>
    <p>E.g. The provenance store cites a HUMINT report that you arent cleared to read</p>
    <p>Some information cannot be determined until well after an event</p>
    <p>E.g. The accuracy of the estimation for 2010 corn eaten cannot be assessed until 2011.</p>
    <p>Provide a mechanism for calculating a trust value for processes other than the relational algebra  Some processes are worse than others</p>
    <p>E.g. a broken AVERAGE function that forgets to divide by the number of items summed.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Proposition: a sentence expressing something is T or F  E.g. C = there are symptoms of DHF at Kilimanjaro</p>
    <p>Belief: subjective probability that the proposition is true  For proposition C, belief = p(C)</p>
    <p>Evidence: a proposition related to another proposition  E.g. p(C|E) = there are symptoms of DHF at Kilimanjaro</p>
    <p>given the State Department Report</p>
