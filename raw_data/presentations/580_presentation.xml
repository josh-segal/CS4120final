    <p>Sharing is caring</p>
    <p>Internet expanding</p>
    <p>More users</p>
    <p>More Web services</p>
    <p>More Web technologies</p>
    <p>Users need to share files</p>
    <p>P2P is not always the answer</p>

    <p>File Hosting Services</p>
    <p>Cloud-storage for the masses</p>

    <p>Security through obscurity access-control</p>
    <p>Sharing personal documents as well as pirated files [1]</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Lifecycle of a file</p>
    <p>Alice decides to shares some digital content (file) through a FHS</p>
    <p>FHS received the file, stores it on its Cloud and generates an identifier which it:</p>
    <p>i. binds with the uploaded file</p>
    <p>ii. returns to the user in a URI form</p>
    <p>URI is shared depending on the nature of the uploaded file</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>File Identifier &amp; Privacy</p>
    <p>The file ID is used to enforce access-control in a security-through-obscurity way</p>
    <p>ID == access to file</p>
    <p>FHS are typically not-searchable</p>
    <p>ID acts as a shared secret between a FHS and each users files</p>
    <p>Non-owners should not be able to guess this secret</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Top 100 FHS</p>
    <p>We studied the top 100 FHS to discover, among others, the way they generate unique secret identifiers</p>
    <p>Uploading files, recording the given ID and comparing</p>
    <p>Removed 12 that had search/browse capabilities</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Sequential IDs</p>
    <p>34/88 FHS were generating sequential identifiers</p>
    <p>numeric, or alphanumerical</p>
    <p>20/34 did not append any other non-guessable information</p>
    <p>e.g. filename or secondary ID</p>
    <p>E.g.</p>
    <p>http://vulnerable.com/9996</p>
    <p>http://vulnerable.com/9997</p>
    <p>http://vulnerable.com/9998</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Scraping file information</p>
    <p>Given a link a user must follow a set of steps to actually download a file</p>
    <p>Download foo.txt -&gt; Free user -&gt; Wait n seconds -&gt; Download foo.txt</p>
    <p>Advantageous for an attacker</p>
    <p>Visit first page, scrape filename and file-size</p>
    <p>Download only the files of interest</p>
  </div>

    <p>Crawling 20 FHS</p>
    <p>Designed a crawler for the 20 sequential FHS</p>
    <p>Run for 30 days</p>
    <p>Random delays to avoid DoS and blacklisting</p>
    <p>Scraping only the filenames and sizes (privacy)</p>
    <p>Results:</p>
    <p>&gt; 310,000 file records</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Finding private files</p>
    <p>Depending on the nature of a file, it will be shared in different ways</p>
    <p>Exploit the ubiquity of search-engine crawlers to characterize a file as private or public.</p>
    <p>Given a filename</p>
    <p>0 search results -&gt; Private</p>

    <p>Ethics</p>
    <p>We didnt download user files</p>
    <p>HoneyFiles were not harmful to a users computer in any way</p>
    <p>HoneyFiles were uploaded as private files in various FHSs</p>
    <p>All vulnerable FHSs were notified</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Large percentage of FHSs fail to provide the user with adequate privacy</p>
    <p>Hundreds of thousands of files ready to be misused</p>
    <p>Attackers know &amp; exploit this fact</p>
