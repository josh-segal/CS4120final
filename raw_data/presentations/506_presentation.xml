    <p>Automated Social Engineering</p>
    <p>Spambot sending spam scales well</p>
    <p>Attack is easy to identify by users</p>
    <p>Phisher chatting with victims is hard to detect by users</p>
    <p>Attack does not scale</p>
    <p>Click here if you want to see me naked: http://123.123.123.123/</p>
    <p>Good morning sir &gt; Good morning We need to verify your details &gt; Why? We do this periodically Could you give me your birth date? &gt; ...</p>
    <p>How could attackers improve this?</p>

    <p>Huber, Kowalski, Nohlberg, Tjoa. Towards automating social engineering using social networking sites. In CSE, 2009.</p>
    <p>Introduced notion of ASE  Chatterbot, identified by users after 3 messages (80%)</p>
    <p>A pathological chatterbot example (ELIZA):</p>
    <p>ElizaEmil</p>
    <p>Hello, I am Eliza.</p>

    <p>Does This Work in Practice?</p>
    <p>Risks for test subjects  Waste of time  Revealing personal information  Emotional consequences</p>
    <p>Careful setup to minimise these risks  Evaluation on IRC during 74 days</p>
    <p>We want to test Honeybot in the wild... ...in an ethical way.</p>
    <p>For clarity of presentation, only results of channel Dating 1.</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Towards automating social engineering  Using human to answer messages  Influence conversation  Automated &amp; human (scalable and difficult to detect)</p>
    <p>Tested spamming &amp; questioning  high click rates  good stealth: you've got a virus, seek help!</p>
    <p>Could be used to spy on conversations in underground economy channels</p>
