    <p>Urban Wireless Networks</p>
    <p>Goal to provide wireless Internet coverage over large areas</p>
    <p>Low cost by leveraging WiFi/mesh technology</p>
    <p>Challenge: to achieve coverage and capacity subject to cost constraints</p>
    <p>Industry example:  But soon it became clear that</p>
    <p>dependable reception required more routers than initially predicted, which drastically raised the cost of building the networks. New York Times. March 22, 2008.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Deployment Assessment Problem</p>
    <p>Challenge: Cannot determine actual network performance until network is deployed</p>
    <p>Objective: Identify whether each client location meets a performance threshold</p>
    <p>Mesh node locations in GoogleWiFi network</p>
    <p>Mesh nodes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Exhaustive Assessment</p>
    <p>Exhaustive measurement study is prohibitively expensive  Especially for staged assessment of newly deployed nodes Instead: Goal is to predict each locations performance with limited</p>
    <p>measurement budget</p>
    <p>? Measure!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Assessment and Estimation</p>
    <p>To predict, we estimate a mesh node's metric region: the set of all locations with measurements meeting a performance threshold</p>
    <p>Related work: ray-tracing used to estimate physical-layer propagation, but high accuracy requires detailed environment info</p>
    <p>Output: mesh assessment</p>

    <p>regions through a small number of measurements:  Measurement process guided by physical-layer estimation and</p>
    <p>prior measurement results  Metric region estimation using coarse-grained terrain maps and the</p>

    <p>Metric Sector Framework</p>
    <p>Challenge: Non-uniform propagation Framework approach: Divide metric region into virtual sectors  Estimate the metric boundary of each sector</p>
    <p>independently</p>
    <p>Example node metric region</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Estimation of Metric Region</p>
    <p>Challenge: Highly variable interactions with terrain results in irregular region boundary</p>
    <p>Framework two-stage approach: 1. Predict propagation variations using terrain maps to estimate</p>
    <p>region boundaries 2. Measure to refine boundaries</p>
    <p>Positive variation</p>
    <p>Average path loss curveNegative</p>
    <p>variation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Estimation via Terrain Features</p>
    <p>Estimate metric region boundary using map information  Use coarse-grain terrain features to predict variations per link  Predicted variation is sum of cumulative impact of each intervening</p>
    <p>terrain feature  Requires training measurements to understand impact of different</p>
    <p>features</p>
    <p>Point 2 Line-of-sight down street --&gt; positive variation</p>
    <p>Point 1 Dense apartment buildings --&gt; negative variation</p>

    <p>Estimating Sector Boundary</p>
    <p>Limit measurements by refining boundary on per sector basis  Number of sectors chosen based on measurement budget  Key technique to use estimations to choose sector widths with</p>
    <p>uniform boundary</p>
    <p>Estimated boundary</p>
    <p>Metric Sector</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Refining Boundary Estimates</p>
    <p>Design simple push/pull heuristic to move each boundary closer/farther from mesh node  Measurement locations guided by estimations and previous</p>
    <p>measurement results  Little state kept to recover from noisy measurements</p>

    <p>Validation on Deployed Networks  Approximately 30,000 measured</p>
    <p>locations in the TFA and GoogleWiFi networks</p>

    <p>terrain, and target area size  Evaluate predictive accuracy of</p>

    <p>Results: Monotonicity Property</p>
    <p>Monotonicity property:  For any ray from a mesh node, metric M is non-increasing with distance</p>
    <p>Allows modeling metric region as a connected region  Consider metrics that (mostly) satisfy</p>
    <p>Coverage (SNR) and metrics based on coverage</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Coverage Monotonicity</p>
    <p>Monotonicity violations due to multi-path  GoogleWiFi features stronger line-of-sight links</p>
    <p>Result in average error per sector of 10% for GoogleWiFi and 15% for TFA</p>
    <p>Results show that estimation and refinement achieve within 3% of upper bound</p>

    <p>Application: Coverage Holes</p>
    <p>Coverage hole is a location outside of any coverage region</p>
    <p>As function of effective deployment density at client locations</p>
    <p>TFA and GoogleWiFi use different hardware, so same probabilities are not expected</p>
    <p>Holes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Examining Coverage Holes</p>
    <p>GoogleWiFi hole probability has much weaker dependence on deployment density</p>
    <p>Holes likely to be in sector with worse-than-average propagation</p>
    <p>Indicates small trouble spots where increasing node density does not help</p>
    <p>Client-side solutions may be most cost-effective</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Assessment Contributions</p>
    <p>Show accurate estimation by coupling terrain maps, pernode virtual sectorization, and measurement refinement</p>
    <p>Show that despite violations of the monotonicity property, framework attains high accuracy on real deployments</p>
    <p>In existing deployments, apply framework to study coverage holes and load balancing  Key challenge: large number of additional nodes needed to</p>
    <p>eliminate numerous small coverage holes</p>
