    <p>Three pieces of old news</p>
    <p>2005: EU introduced carbon emission caps to large energy consumers</p>
    <p>Cap and trade: if cap exhausted, then buy more credits</p>
    <p>2007: eBay paid $79K fine to Sacramento, CA, for using generators and polluting air</p>
    <p>2011: Microsoft faced $210K penalty from Quincy, WA, utilities for overestimating its energy usage</p>

    <p>Energy cap!</p>
    <p>There is an energy cap</p>
    <p>Penalty for exceeding the cap</p>
    <p>Stricter energy caps are anticipated in light of the increasingly serious sustainability concerns</p>
    <p>In order to satisfy the cap, data centers need to carefully use their energy quota</p>

    <p>Solution</p>
    <p>Turn on as few servers as possible to satisfy QoS  But, what should be the energy cap?</p>
    <p>Energy oversubscription</p>
    <p>Like what Microsoft did for its Quincy, WA, data center</p>
    <p>Clearly, not good for power utilities</p>

    <p>Another solution  Plan everything ahead, assuming that we know everything</p>
    <p>about the future (e.g., workloads, renewables, etc.) [3]</p>
    <p>How can we accurately predict the future?</p>
    <p>Hour-ahead or day-ahead traffic/renewables prediction may be good, but month-ahead or even season-ahead predictions may NOT be!</p>

    <p>Our proposal</p>

    <p>Long-term prediction may not be accurate</p>
    <p>Why not just give a rough estimate in advance and then try to follow your target online?</p>
    <p>Challenge</p>
    <p>We have long-term target, but we only have shortterm information</p>

    <p>Model</p>
    <p>Time-slotted model</p>
    <p>Data center has  homogeneous servers</p>
    <p>On-site renewable energy available</p>
    <p>Capacity provisioning decisions are made at the beginning of each time slot</p>
    <p>Service process at each server is modeled by a FIFO queue</p>

    <p>Objectives</p>
    <p>Electricity bill</p>
    <p>Reduced by using fewer servers</p>
    <p>QoS</p>
    <p>Response time</p>
    <p>QoS can be increased by using more servers</p>

    <p>Construct an energy deficit queue</p>
    <p>Queue length indicate the energy budget deficit</p>
    <p>Instead of minimizing the cost, minimize the following</p>
    <p>,  +()     ,    +</p>
    <p>Queue length gives additional weight on electricity usage</p>
    <p>Larger queue means: more energy is used than allowed budget</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Impact of energy budget</p>
    <p>Average cost of ORM increases when the energy budget decreases</p>
    <p>With 90% energy budget, average cost ORM only exceeds by approximately 3%</p>
