    <p>Over 40 Data Centers (DCs) on EC2, Azure, Google Cloud  A geographically denser set of DCs across clouds</p>
    <p>Cloud apps host on multiple DCs  Web search, Interactive Multimedia  Low latency access, privacy regulations</p>
    <p>Massive data across geo-distributed DCs</p>
    <p>Background</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>WAN is Crucial for Geo-distributed Service</p>
    <p>Bandwidth-intensive transfers  Geo-distributed replication: Web search, cloud storage  Inter-DC Routing: SWAN[SIGCOMM13], Pretium[SIGCOMM16], etc  Big data analytics: Iridium [SIGCOMM15], Clarinet [OSDI16]</p>
    <p>Latency-sensitive traffic  Interactive service: Skype, Hangout  Transaction processing: SPANStore[SOSP13], Carousel[SIGMOD18], etc</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>WAN bandwidth(b/w) varies significantly between different regions  Close regions have more than12 of the b/w than distant regions[1]</p>

    <p>Reproduce prior measurements  11 EC2 regions, 110 inter-DC pairs  Tools: iperf (TCP)</p>
    <p>Heterogeneous link capacity  Varies between the same type of VMs  Lower b/w between distant regions</p>
    <p>Relay should work pretty well</p>
    <p>WAN Bandwidth Varies Spatially</p>

    <p>About 40% percent data transfers between EC2 regions can have more than 1.5x bandwidth increase via relay</p>

    <p>How to identify and tackle this complicated WAN?</p>
    <p>- Heterogeneous across regions - Dynamic runtime environment - Great complexity in sys design</p>
