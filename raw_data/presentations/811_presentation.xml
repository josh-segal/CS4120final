    <p>What Is Auditing?</p>
    <p>Post-election auditing is useful for detecting accidental or malicious errors</p>
    <p>Precinct auditing procedure:  Determine the set of precincts to audit</p>
    <p>Use randomization</p>
    <p>Hand count paper ballots in sampled precincts</p>
    <p>Compare hand count to electronic tally:  If sufficiently close, declare electronic result final</p>
    <p>If significantly different, investigate!</p>

    <p>votes)  Half margin of victory is least number of corrupted votes  Achieves a desired level of confidence  Typically precincts sampled with equal probability</p>
    <p>How to Select Precincts?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 5</p>
    <p>Previous Work</p>
    <p>SAFE [McCarthy et al., 2007]  Compute least number of corrupted votes from margin</p>
    <p>of victory  Compute least number of corrupted precincts</p>
    <p>Assume larger precincts are corrupted first</p>
    <p>Precincts are audited with equal probability  Sample size ensures desired level of confidence</p>
    <p>Inefficient when precinct sizes vary significantly  Our methods reduce the workload by about half</p>
    <p>Corrupted votes Precincts</p>

    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Larger precincts can allow greater fraud  Should audit with higher probability</p>
    <p>Precinct sizes vary greatly  Largest: 1637 votes</p>
    <p>Smallest: 132 votes</p>
    <p>More than an order of magnitude!</p>
    <p>Votes</p>
    <p>Precinct Number1</p>
    <p>Ohio 2004 Congressional District 5</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 7</p>
    <p>Goal</p>
    <p>Significance (confidence):  If the election result is corrupted, at least one</p>
    <p>corrupted precinct is detected at the desired significance</p>
    <p>If no fraud is detected, the election result is certified at the desired significance</p>
    <p>Efficiency:  Few votes and precincts audited</p>
    <p>Devise efficient auditing procedures by considering precinct sizes</p>

    <p>Example: Ohio 2004 Congressional District 5  n precincts</p>
    <p>n = 640 precincts</p>
    <p>vi = number of votes in precinct i  v1vn = 1637132 votes</p>
    <p>V = total number of votes (vi)  V = 315,540 votes</p>
    <p>Model</p>
    <p>v1 v2 vn-1 vn</p>
    <p>Corrupted precinct</p>
    <p>Good precinct</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 9</p>
    <p>Model (contd)</p>
    <p>M = margin of victory in votes  Vote difference between winner and runner-up</p>
    <p>M/2 is least number of corrupted votes if election is fraudulent</p>
    <p>If winner won by 1% over the runner-up, M = 3,155 votes</p>
    <p>_ = desired significance level  1 - confidence level  8% (confidence of 92%)</p>

    <p>Approach</p>
    <p>Sets of same total size have about the same probability of being audited:</p>
    <p>Paper presents error bounds instead of sizes  kvi, k = 0.4 [Dopp and Stenger, 2006]</p>
    <p>Each precinct is audited with a probability dependent on its size, vi.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 11</p>
    <p>Our Methods</p>
    <p>Two methods:  NegExp</p>
    <p>Each precinct is audited independently with a probability dependent on its size</p>
    <p>PPEBWR  One precinct is selected during each of a sequence</p>
    <p>of rounds with a probability proportional to its size</p>
    <p>Both ensure the desired significance level independent of the adversarial strategy</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 12</p>
    <p>NegExp Method</p>
    <p>Negative Exponential</p>
    <p>Audit each precinct independently with probability:</p>
    <p>The chance of auditing at least one precinct from a set of precincts is given by the total size  Example: a set of two precincts i and j</p>
    <p>Condition for significance level:</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 13</p>
    <p>PPEBWR Method</p>
    <p>Probability proportional to error bound (size) with replacement</p>
    <p>During each round, one precinct is selected with the probability distribution:</p>
    <p>Repetitions (rare) audited only once</p>
    <p>Number of rounds for the desired significance:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 14</p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <p>Largest precinct: v1 = 1637 votes</p>
    <p>Smallest precinct: vn = 132 votes</p>
    <p>NegExp:  p1 = 41%, pn = 4.1%</p>
    <p>PPEBWR:  During each round: p1 = 0.52%, pn = 0.042%</p>
    <p>Over all the rounds: p1 = 40%, pn = 4.1%</p>
    <p>Both have similar final auditing probabilities</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 15</p>
    <p>Dice Rolls in NegExp</p>
    <p>Audit a precinct with probability p:  Roll four ten-sided dice to get a four-decimal</p>
    <p>number</p>
    <p>Audit the precinct if the result is smaller than p</p>
    <p>Example:  p1 = 0.41 audit</p>
    <p>pn = 0.041 do not audit</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 16</p>
    <p>Dice Rolls in PPEBWR</p>
    <p>Audit a precinct from the distribution:</p>
    <p>Consider each vote labeled from 1 to V and select a vote number at random  Roll a ten-sided die for each digit</p>
    <p>Repeat until number is from 1 to V  Audit the precinct containing the vote</p>

    <p>_ = 8%</p>
    <p>Margin of victory 1%</p>
    <p>Expected number of votes to audit (vipi)  SAFE: 95,155 (30%)</p>
    <p>NegExp: 50,937 (16%)</p>

    <p>Comparison to SAFE</p>

    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 18</p>
    <p>Expected number of precincts audited (pi)  Votes versus precinct number for audited</p>
    <p>precincts:</p>
    <p>About twice as efficient</p>
    <p>Comparison to SAFE (contd)</p>
    <p>Mean: 91.6 precincts (14%)</p>

    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 19</p>
    <p>NegExp is more flexible:  Races with overlapping jurisdictions</p>
    <p>Adjusting auditing probabilities  Remember dice roll outcome and decide whether</p>
    <p>to audit or not</p>
    <p>NegExp vs. PPEBWR</p>
    <p>p2=0.3 p1=0.7</p>
    <p>Jurisdiction 1 Jurisdiction 2  Sample with maximum</p>
    <p>probability from each race (p1=0.7)</p>
    <p>Recommended where flexibility is needed</p>
    <p>Precinct</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>July 28, 2008 Electronic Voting Technology 2008 20</p>
    <p>PPEBWR is more efficient  Slightly less precincts and votes audited on</p>
    <p>average</p>
    <p>Less dice rolls  NegExp rolls dice per precinct (eg. 640)</p>
    <p>PPEBWR rolls dice per round (eg. 100)</p>
    <p>NegExp vs. PPEBWR (contd)</p>
    <p>Recommended for simple elections</p>

    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>Two new practical auditing procedures based on precinct sizes  NegExp</p>
    <p>PPEBWR</p>
    <p>About twice as efficient as previous approaches</p>
