    <p>Data Domain Cloud Tier</p>
    <p>Active Tier</p>
    <p>Backup files are first ingested into active tier</p>

    <p>Active Tier (Data and Metadata)</p>
    <p>ECS (Object Storage)</p>
    <p>Off prem</p>
    <p>Cloud Tier (Metadata Only)</p>
    <p>Benefits  Reduce cost of long-term storage</p>
    <p>Deduplication &amp; compression  Efficient data transfer that minimizes</p>
    <p>transfer costs  Reduces operational costs compared to</p>
    <p>tapes</p>
    <p>Disaster recovery if on-prem Data Domain is destroyed</p>
    <p>Simplicity  Single namespace with tiering</p>

    <p>Cloud Tier</p>
    <p>- Selected data is moved to cloud tier</p>
    <p>- Deduplicated, compressed and encrypted data is sent to object storage</p>
    <p>- Meta-data is mirrored on local storage and object storage</p>

    <p>Key highlights of our architecture</p>
    <p>Meta-data cached locally to assist deduplication and garbage collection</p>
    <p>Move incremental data with deduplication to the object storage efficiently</p>
    <p>Uses perfect hashing and breadth-first Merkle tree traversal  Find out how much space will be freed by moving data to cloud tier  Seed large amount of data efficiently to the object storage  Clean cloud tier (garbage collection)</p>
    <p>Provides efficient cleaning for private and public cloud providers using API integration and microservices</p>

    <p>Summary of field evaluation results</p>
    <p>Analyzed field results from hundreds of sampled customers running cloud tier (first released in April 2016)</p>
    <p>Some of our customers have moved 20PB of data to the cloud tier saving millions of dollars due to benefits of deduplication and compression</p>
    <p>Total compression (deduplication * local compression) for our sampled cloud tier customers ranges from 4X to 100X</p>
