    <p>USABILITY ISSUES WITH EXISTING AUTHENTICATION SCHEMES</p>
    <p>Khan et al. [SOUPS 15] conducted a study to understand the usability issues arising from re-authentication</p>
    <p>They simulated false rejects for a touch input based behavior scheme and used the default lock configuration</p>
    <p>Almost 35% of the users found it annoying because of the unpredictable nature of reauthentication and the context switch overhead due to it</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>CONTRIBUTIONS6</p>
    <p>We modify two widely deployed authentication mechanisms to make them more usable for re authentication scenarios without significantly comprising on security</p>
    <p>We evaluate the perceived security and usability of the configurations by performing lab experiments with 30 participants using synthetic tasks</p>

    <p>APPARATUS</p>
    <p>We perform a lab-based study and invite participants to experience the configurations by performing synthetic tasks</p>

    <p>We simulate an IA scheme based on users touch or keystroke behavior</p>
    <p>We select two popular authentication mechanisms:  4-digit PIN and  Android pattern lock</p>

    <p>USABILITY PERCEPTION34</p>
    <p>It [Grad-Lock] helps you to continue typing and get your thoughts out. It didnt allow you to access the app though [after sometime] so its a good balance between usability and</p>

    <p>USABILITY PERCEPTION35</p>

    <p>CONCLUSION</p>
    <p>We perform the first study for designing and evaluating new reauthentication configurations</p>
    <p>Our proposed configurations perform as well as the default configuration in terms of task performance</p>
    <p>User preferences are context-based  Default configuration is preferred for highly sensitive apps  Preferences for medium and less sensitive apps vary depending on users</p>
