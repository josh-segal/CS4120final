    <p>MicroRNAs</p>
    <p>miRNAs are a part of epigenetics</p>
    <p>miRNAs are small RNA molecules, which regulate most of the human genes  i.e., they regulate what a cell does / what type of cell it is</p>
    <p>miRNA expression quantifies how much miRNAs are active in a given cell  a real-valued number for each miRNA  e.g., hsa-let-7a-1: 102</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">

    <p>MicroRNAs</p>
    <p>highly influenced by external factors  e.g., ageing, diet, childhood development, environmental</p>
    <p>chemicals  thus, highly variable over time</p>
    <p>miRNA expression reflects the health status  due to their influence on gene expression</p>
    <p>associations between miRNA expression and  neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimers),</p>
    <p>heart disease, diabetes, majority of cancer types  and more to follow</p>

    <p>regulates what a cell really does,</p>
    <p>expression changes over time,  can tell whether you carry a</p>
    <p>disease.</p>

    <p>see: Routes for breaching and protecting genetic privacy, Erich and Narayanan (2014)</p>
    <p>Common belief: no privacy threats from miRNAs, because of temporal variability</p>

    <p>Revisiting Research Questions  Conclusion</p>
    <p>Yes, up to 90% success rate for blood-based samples!</p>
    <p>Noising can reduce the success rate to almost random guessing.</p>
    <p>Noising in general provides a better privacy-utility trade-off.</p>
    <p>Privacy doubles, while utility cost is less than 1% for most diseases! 37</p>
