    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Bidding in sealed-bid, IPV settings</p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <p>Purchasing a used car:</p>
    <p>Evaluating a price is difficult.</p>
    <p>Residual uncertainty</p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <p>Pay-per-click advertising:</p>
    <p>i.i.d. value per click: needs data to learn distribution</p>
    <p>Values can change abruptly.</p>
    <p>How to model this for equilibrium analysis?</p>
  </div>

    <p>Terms</p>
    <p>Type divides into1:</p>
    <p>payoff type (valuation) belief type (private information)</p>
    <p>Deliberation: action that secretly updates belief type</p>
    <p>introspection: updates agents beliefs about their own valuation. strategic deliberation2: updates agents beliefs about other agents valuation.</p>
    <p>Beliefs over time with residual uncertainty:</p>
    <p>ex ante: no private information ex interim: one agents private information ex post: all agents private information ex interim perfect: one agents valuation ex post perfect: all agents valuations</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Introduction 2nd Price Auctions General Results Conclusion</p>
    <p>Taxonomy</p>
    <p>We classify settings with deliberative agents along five major axes:</p>
    <p>Valuation distribution: Are agents valuations independent?</p>
    <p>Privacy: Can agents discover information about each others valuations?</p>
    <p>Volatility: Can an agents valuation change?</p>
    <p>Perfection: Can an agent buy/consume the good without knowing his valuation?</p>
    <p>Costliness: Do deliberations carry a utility penalty?</p>
    <p>Limitations: When can agents perform deliberations?</p>
    <p>Separability: Can agents condition their deliberations on information from the mechanism?</p>

    <p>Model</p>
    <p>Definition</p>
    <p>Our model is a six-tuple (N, f, Q, A, p, c) where: N is the set of all agents.</p>
    <p>Each agent has a valuation vi drawn from distribution f (which has support on the interval [v, v]). Q is the set of possible introspections (from which each agent chooses one, qi). q is no introspection.</p>
    <p>A is the set of possible signals the agent can receive, according to conditional probability distribution p(ai|qi, vi). c(qi, ai) is the cost of the signal (quasi-linear).</p>

    <p>Properties of model</p>
    <p>Proposition</p>
    <p>If the setting is separable, independent valued and private then risk-neutral agents will bid as though their expected valuation was their exact valuation.</p>
    <p>Proposition</p>
    <p>Our model is without loss of generality regarding some important features:</p>
    <p>deliberation costs affected by valuation</p>
    <p>multiple deliberations (with limitations)</p>
    <p>initial information</p>

    <p>Theorem: value of information</p>
    <p>Theorem</p>
    <p>In efficient, separable auctions with independent private values, the value of information for any deliberation policy q falls off exponentially in the number of agents performing it.</p>
    <p>Proof Sketch</p>
    <p>If we only allow the k agents that perform q to participate, we have symmetric IVDs and standard E[u] equations apply (i.e. an agent receives the good with probability F k1q (E[vi|qi = q, ai]).) If we re-introduce bidders who do not perform q, E[ui|qi = q] weakly decreases.</p>
