    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>Smart homes offer great promise but have clear security and privacy risks</p>
    <p>Demographically-diverse home users drive a need for user-centered security and privacy</p>
    <p>Looking beyond usability, we look at how designers factor User Experience (UX) principles into the security and privacy design of smart cameras</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Methods</p>
    <p>20 employees from 3 companies (6, 8, 6)</p>
    <p>Recruitment from online platforms</p>
    <p>Semi-structured interviews (~52 minutes)</p>
    <p>Remote interviews (Zoom, Skype)</p>
    <p>Grounded Theory analysis (155 codes)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Results</p>
    <p>Stakeholders divided into 6 groups according to job responsibilities: security, regulatory, UX, management, software and hardware.</p>
    <p>Five themes identified through Grounded Theory:  Development Process  UX in Security Design  UX in Privacy Design  Innovation in Security and Privacy Design  Trust</p>
