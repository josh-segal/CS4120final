    <p>Security products are an important line of defence against current threats  The success of malware depends upon both technical and human factors  Users are involved in both the infection and protection process</p>
    <p>Security products should be tested:  With actual users that interact with the product  In a realistic environment  Over an extended period of time</p>
    <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>OUTLINE</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Security solutions would be installed and monitored on systems in regular use by regular users</p>
    <p>Data would be gathered on:</p>
    <p>The performance of the security product in protecting the system  How the user interact with the system during this time period</p>
    <p>We performed a 4-month pilot study that involved 50 subjets in order to:  Develop and test the validity and viability of the methodology  Determine how malware infects computer systems and characterize sources of</p>
    <p>malware infections  Determine how factors such as the configuration of the system, the environment</p>
    <p>in which the system is used, and user behavior affect the probability of infection of a system</p>

    <p>Protocol certification and approval  Computer security risks evaluation committee  Reseach ethics review committee</p>
    <p>Computer risk  Guarantee that subjects were not going to be significantly more at risk than the</p>
    <p>average home computer user who had installed an up-to-date reputable antivirus  Protect the universitys IT infrastructure as the experiment implied manipulation of</p>
    <p>malware files</p>
    <p>Ethics and privacy considerations  Guarantee the anonymity of the participants  Guarantee confidentiality of the data collected</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Equipment:  We provided the same laptop to the subjects  All laptops had an identical configurations (OS, tools, AV product, etc)</p>
    <p>Data collected with scripts:  List of applications installed and applications for which updates are available  Number of Web sites visited and type of Web sites visited  Number and types of files downloaded  The list of different locations from which the laptop establish connected to the Internet  The list of plug-ins installed  Number of different hosts to which to laptop communicated  Number of hours per day the laptop is connected to the Internet  Number of hours per day the laptop is on</p>

    <p>Subject recruiting by advertising the experiment on the University campus</p>
    <p>Users were required to attend 5 in-person sessions Initial session:</p>
    <p>Obtain informed consent from users  Provide laptop to users  Invite users to complete initial questionnaire (gender, age, status, field of activity,</p>
    <p>etc.)</p>
    <p>Monthly sessions:  Invite users to answer on-line questionnaire to:</p>
    <p>Assess experience and opinion of the AV product  Gain insights about how the computer was used  Determine users level of security awareness and measure of due diligence they exert</p>
    <p>to secure their computer  Collection of statistical data</p>
    <p>COMPUTER SECURITY CLINICAL TRIALS</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Monthly sessions:  Analysis of the computer to find malware missed by the AV product</p>
    <p>Tools: HijackThis, ProcessExplorer, Sigcheck, Autoruns, SpyBHORemover, SpyDLLRemover, Whatchanged, Winprefectview</p>
    <p>Elements were classified using external online ressources: www.systemlookup.com, www.processlibrary.com, VirusTotal, Anubis, etc.</p>
    <p>Files identified as suspicious or dangerous were subject to an in-depth investigation</p>
    <p>If a malicous file is identified by the AV product or our protocol:  User is asked to answer a questionnaire to collect more information regarding the potential</p>
    <p>means and sources of the infection, and any behavioural changes obserbed on the computer  Additional consent is requested from user to collect specific data, such as the browser</p>
    <p>history, the tshark log files, and the suspected file(s)</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Final session:  Similar to the other monthly sessions  Users had to answer a post-experiment questionnaire to:</p>
    <p>Assess their overall experience in the study  Help us ide</p>
    <p>Users were asked to keep the collected data for an additional period of 3 months in the event me might need to perform more in-depth analysis on the computer</p>
    <p>We provided users procedures to:  Stop the automatic collection of the data  Delete the data and tools we installed  Reinstall the operating system, if they wanted to do so</p>

    <p>OUTLINE</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Estimate the required population size before the study  The required population size is based on many factors:</p>
    <p>Form of the experiment  Hypotheses to be tested  Desired power of experiment results  Budget available</p>
    <p>Power analysis can help estimate the number of subjects based on:  The desired power (indicator of how statistically significant the results may be)  The desired statistical level of significance  The effect to be measured (estimated based on prior studies, literature review,</p>
    <p>logical assertation and conjecture)</p>
    <p>LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMANDATIONS</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Select users on a scientific and ethical basis  Specify the target population using appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria  Recruit users based on their characteristics depending on the hypotheses to be</p>
    <p>tested</p>

    <p>Identify relevant independant variables  Choose the data to be collected based on the research questions</p>
    <p>Identifiy appropriate independant variables that may affect the dependent variable</p>
    <p>How ? Produce an Ishikawa diagram (aka fishbone diagram or cause-and-effect diagram) to identify potential factors</p>

    <p>Select the appropriate data collection method  The collection method should depend on:</p>
    <p>The data you want to collect  The research questions you want to address  The type of data analysis you want to perform</p>
    <p>Example: We collected the number of applications installed thought surveys and</p>
    <p>scripts  Average number of applications installed from surveys = 19.02  Average number of applications installed from real data = 67.78  Recommandation: survey results should be cross-checked with another</p>
    <p>collection source before analysis</p>
    <p>LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMANDATIONS</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Understand the data before the analysis  Collected data should be subject to an in-depth investigation to detect and</p>
    <p>understand any anomalies such as:  Missing data  Outliers (residual analysis)</p>
    <p>Example: One user had more than 100 detections from the AV product when all others had less than 30 detections  Cause: An infected file that the AV was not able to remove, which resulted in</p>
    <p>multiple detections  User has been considered as an outlier and was removed for the analysis</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Ground truthing and in-depth analysis  Number of malware encounters: provided by the AV  Number of malware infections: based on our protocol</p>
    <p>Could have been underestimated</p>
    <p>Type of malware  Malware classification is inconsistent from one AV vendor to another  The problem is even worse with unwanted software (adware, spyware, etc.)  Solution: in-depth forensics analysis based on the collected data</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Evaluate potential bias before the study  Controlling factors can reduce experimental bias, but they can also reduce the</p>
    <p>ecological validity of the results  We had to control system configuration variables that could affect AV</p>
    <p>performance in protecting the system  Users had the same laptop, same OS, same AV, same tools, etc.  They not allowed to install another AV, uninstall or disactivate the AV being evaluated</p>
    <p>We decided to evaluate the bias related to user behavior and environment, rather than control it  Users share their computer, use VM, use a private navigation mode, etc.  We asked the users at the end of the experiment how they may have changed</p>
    <p>their behavior knowing that they were participating in the study 20</p>

    <p>OUTLINE</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>We showed that computer security clinical trials are a viable and complementary alternative to traditional testing</p>
    <p>Designing and conducting such studies presents many scientific, technical and ethical challenges</p>
    <p>Computer security clinical trials could:  Help AV vendors to improve their products and understand how users adopt security</p>
    <p>solutions and react the security threats  Be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of training and education on users  Help key deciders in IT to make better evidence-based decisions</p>
