    <p>ENTER REC4LRW</p>
    <p>Rec4LRW is a task-based assistive system that offers</p>
    <p>recommendations for the below tasks:</p>
    <p>Task 1  Building an initial reading list of research papers</p>
    <p>Task 2  Finding similar papers based on a seed set of papers</p>
    <p>(multiple papers)</p>
    <p>Task 3  Shortlisting papers from the final reading list based on</p>
    <p>article-type preference</p>
    <p>The system is based on a threefold intervention framework</p>
    <p>For better meeting the task requirements</p>
    <p>For speeding up the relevance judgement decisions</p>
    <p>For establishing the natural relationships between tasks</p>

    <p>STUDY INFORMATION</p>
    <p>The study was conducted between November 2015 and January 2016</p>
    <p>Pre-screening survey conducted to identify participants who have authored at</p>
    <p>least one journal or conference paper</p>
    <p>116 participants completed the whole study inclusive of the three tasks in the</p>
    <p>system</p>
    <p>57 participants were Ph.D./Masters students while 59 were research staff,</p>
    <p>academic staff and librarians</p>
    <p>The average research experience for students was 2 years while for staff, it</p>
    <p>was 5.6 years</p>
    <p>51% of participants were from the computer science, electrical and</p>
    <p>electronics disciplines, 35% from information and communication studies</p>
    <p>discipline while 14% from other disciplines 9</p>

    <p>STUDY PROCEDURE</p>
    <p>Step 1: Participant selects one of the available 43 topics for executing task 1</p>
    <p>Step 2: Re-run task 1 and select at least five papers for the seed basket</p>
    <p>Step 3: Execute task 2 with the seed basket papers</p>
    <p>Step 4: Re-run task 2 (and task 1) to select at least 30 papers for the final</p>
    <p>reading list</p>
    <p>Step 5: Execute task 3 with the final reading list papers and article-type</p>
    <p>preference</p>
    <p>Four article-type choices: conference full paper, poster, case study and a</p>
    <p>generic research paper</p>

    <p>RESULTS</p>
    <p>Biggest differences found for the below measures:</p>
    <p>Usefulness (82.00% for students, 64.15% for staff)</p>
    <p>Good_List (76.00% for students, 62.26% for staff)</p>
    <p>The measures with the highest agreement:</p>
    <p>Importance (85.96% for students, 77.97% for staff)</p>
    <p>Shortlisting_Feature (84.21% for students, 74.58% for staff)</p>

    <p>QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK</p>
    <p>The newly introduced informational display features were a big hit</p>
    <p>The purely experimental nature of the study affected the experience of</p>
    <p>participants</p>
    <p>Tasks effectiveness needs to be validated with a longitudinal study with a</p>
    <p>large collection of papers in the final reading list</p>
    <p>Rank Preferred Aspects Categories Critical Aspects Categories</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>LIMITATIONS</p>
    <p>Lack of an offline evaluation experiment</p>
    <p>Study procedure involved selection of comparatively fewer number of papers</p>
    <p>in the final reading list</p>
    <p>Not much variations in the final shortlisted papers for the different article-type</p>
    <p>preferences</p>
    <p>Information displayed in a purely textual manner</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>FUTURE WORK</p>
    <p>The scope for this task will be expanded to bring in more variations for the</p>
    <p>different article-type choices</p>
    <p>Inclusion of new papers in the output which could have been missed during</p>
    <p>the literature review</p>
    <p>Provide more user control in the system so that the user can select papers as</p>
    <p>mandatory to be shortlisted</p>
    <p>Integrate this task with the citation context recommendation task</p>
    <p>Represent the information in the form of citation graphs</p>
