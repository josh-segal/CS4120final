    <p>Most anti-SPAM tools are receiver-oriented Proper filtering actions are taken AFTER</p>

    <p>Sophos MailMessage, MailSWAT, MailStripper  the client level</p>
    <p>Sophos MailMonitor, WebWasher  at both levels</p>

    <p>Try to fight SPAM acting on the SPAM sources</p>
    <p>Examples: SMTP server black/white lists Issues with black lists:</p>
    <p>brute force approach, does not scale with the increasing number of spammers</p>
    <p>black lists do not help in reducing unwanted traffic</p>
    <p>Issues with white lists:  really effective for specific user communities</p>
