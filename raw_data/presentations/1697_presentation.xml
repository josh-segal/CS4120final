    <p>Our Solution DNS is a core Internet service Significant network complexity in todays Internet  Trillions of DNS requests per day  Proliferation of public DNS servers  CDNs</p>
    <p>Leverage this complexity in DNS traffic to hide information</p>

    <p>DNS-sly Overview</p>
    <p>Components : DNS-sly requester and responder DNS-sly responder profiles the clients DNS behavior Exchanges profile information with the requester In the downstream direction, responder encodes the content from the censored website in DNS response packets</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>First Phase - Endpoint Profiling DNS-sly responder profiles clients DNS behavior  Records domains  Forms IP set per domain</p>
    <p>Creates profile map  a mapping of domains to the server IPs they are hosted on Exchanges profile map with the requester via out-of-band communication</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>Second Phase - Communication In the upstream direction, the DNS-sly requester crafts DNS requests using the profile map Upon receiving the request, the responder retrieves the content from Web In the downstream direction, the DNS-sly responder encodes content using DNS responses</p>

    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>Encoding Data Goal - Represent data as a choice of A records from a pool of IP addresses Responder computes the number of bytes of data to be encoded Uses a number representation scheme to map data to a set of IP addresses Forms a valid DNS response and sends it back to the DNS-sly requester</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>Encoding Data - Example</p>
    <p>Domain =  facebook.com  IP set size = 256 Number of A records = 6 Choices ~ P(256,6) Data encoded = 6 Bytes</p>

    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>DNS Request Variability Fragmented Web pages Larger number of DNS requests better for deniability:  DNS-sly requests hard to detect  Leads to increased probability of DNS</p>
    <p>responses suitable for data encoding</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>Number of DNS Resolutions per Domain</p>
    <p>Median is ~50 DNS resolutions per domain</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>DNS Response Variability Number of IP addresses a domain maps to determines the potential for encoding downstream data  Global and local</p>
    <p>Number of A records determines data that can be embedded in a single DNS response Rate of change in A records determines the timescales at which to operate to retain statistical deniability</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>Experimental Results</p>
    <p>Maximum number of IPs a domain maps to is 850</p>
    <p>~ 1/3rd of DNS responses have 8 A records with maximum up to 15,</p>
    <p>Every 30 minutes the responses change completely</p>

    <p>Security Evaluation: Methodology Emulated a censors probing attack For every response from a DNS-sly responder, queried five other DNS resolvers for the same domain Evaluated by computing the mean and variance of the change between the DNS responses</p>

    <p>Performance Evaluation: Methodology Evaluated downstream performance using the metric, bytes per click  Single click defined as loading of a page, including</p>
    <p>DNS resolutions for all domains included on the page</p>
    <p>Deployed DNS-sly in a known-censored environment to exchange data from a knowncensored website</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>Performance Evaluation: Results</p>
    <p>Median Page Click (global) &gt; 100 Bytes</p>
    <p>Median Page Click (local) ~ 75 Bytes</p>
    <p>Maximum Bytes encoded ~ 600 Bytes</p>

    <p>Qurat-Ul-Ann Akbar DNS-sly: Avoiding Censorship through Network Complexity</p>
    <p>Conclusion DNS-sly: a system that enables a DNS covert channel which provides high deniability while maintaining good performance DNS-sly adjusts its behavior to the clients Utilizes frequently changing A records to embed data in DNS responses Achieves downstream throughput of upto 600 Bytes of hidden data per Web page click</p>
