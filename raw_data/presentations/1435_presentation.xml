    <p>Problem: Vulnerability scanners limited  Only evaluates individual machines</p>
    <p>Cannot show how vulnerabilities relate</p>
    <p>Example: Foothold situation  Attacker compromises machine A</p>
    <p>Machine A has private communication channel with machine B</p>
    <p>Attacker uses machine A to attack machine B</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>California State University, Bakersfield</p>
    <p>Nodes of the graph  Initial nodes represent the present state of the</p>
    <p>network</p>
    <p>Interior and terminal nodes represent states the attacker has achieved</p>
    <p>Edges of the graph  Attacks executed by attacker</p>
    <p>Represented visually as a diamond node</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>California State University, Bakersfield</p>
    <p>Exploit path is sequence from initial nodes to a terminal node</p>
    <p>Discovers exploit paths through attack template requires/provides syntax</p>
    <p>Templates have preconditions (requirements) and postconditions (consequences)</p>
    <p>Postcondition of one attack may be a precondition for another attack</p>
    <p>Path is sequence of such relationships</p>

    <p>Input data  List of vulnerabilities present on all machines</p>

    <p>Attacker model  Assumes a single attacker for each graph</p>
    <p>Initial privileges attacker has on all machines</p>

    <p>Can model insider and outsider scenarios</p>

    <p>Preprocessing  Convert all vulnerabilities and port numbers to</p>
    <p>abstract model</p>
    <p>Cluster identical machines  Must have same vulnerabilities AND connectivity  Less work for the generator</p>
    <p>Generation  Use expert system to discover all possible</p>

    <p>Evolutionary Method</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>California State University, Bakersfield</p>
    <p>Goal: Prevent attacker from achieving certain resources (goal nodes) in graph</p>
    <p>Evolutionary Method  Computationally infeasible to brute force</p>
    <p>Start with random solutions  Solution varies with analysis mode</p>
    <p>Use genetic algorithm to refine solutions  Guided search of solution space</p>
    <p>Flexible and allows multiple solutions</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>California State University, Bakersfield</p>
    <p>Example: Find a set of patches  Initial solutions are random subset of patches</p>
    <p>Applies patches to graph and sees how well the patches disconnect the goal nodes</p>
    <p>Assign a fitness metric</p>
    <p>Select solutions with best fitness</p>
    <p>Breed them to create next generation</p>
    <p>Repeat</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>California State University, Bakersfield</p>
    <p>Assessing fitness is most CPU intensive task  Must apply each hardening measure and</p>
    <p>cascade its effects throughout the graph  Over 60% of the single-threaded application</p>
    <p>CPU time was spent in this function  Switched this task to multi-threaded function</p>
    <p>Each has its own copy of the attack graph</p>
    <p>Memory is cheap, time is not (usually)</p>

    <p>Fitness metric measures benefit of solution and cost of solution</p>
    <p>Affected by mode of analysis and policy</p>
    <p>Policy model allows defaults specified by mode to be overridden</p>
    <p>Can override both costs and benefits for specific cases or general cases</p>
    <p>Can have a different policy for different modes of analysis</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>California State University, Bakersfield</p>
    <p>Find set of hardening measures  Prevent attacker from reaching resources by</p>
    <p>patching machines, applying new firewall or router rules and/or placing IDS sensors</p>
    <p>Can also be run in patch only mode</p>
    <p>Solution is a proposed set of measures</p>
    <p>Fitness metric based on cost for measures in set and how well they disconnect the attacker from the goal nodes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>California State University, Bakersfield</p>
    <p>Strategic Planning  Assess unknown risks by asking what if</p>
    <p>Affects the generation of the attack graph</p>
    <p>Alter the vulnerability list or firewall/router rules to reflect the scenario</p>
    <p>Generate an attack graph for the scenario</p>
    <p>Analyze resulting graph using any other mode</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>California State University, Bakersfield</p>
    <p>Network Design  Simple mode  Administrator designs several different sets of</p>
    <p>firewall and/or router rules for the network</p>
    <p>Attack graph is generated for each design</p>
    <p>Risk metric is calculated based on how well connected the goal nodes are to the graph</p>
    <p>Design with lowest risk metric is selected</p>
    <p>Simple mode is not very interesting  Just a variation on strategic planning</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>California State University, Bakersfield</p>
    <p>Network Design  Evolutionary Mode  Administrator gives a single prototype design</p>
    <p>Evolutionary analysis seeks improvements</p>
    <p>Solutions alter firewall/router rules or place IDS sensors</p>
    <p>Fitness metric based on how well goal nodes are disconnected or watched</p>
    <p>Outputs several designs that minimize both risk and cost</p>

    <p>Forensic Evaluation and IDS Alerts  Match forensic evidence and/or IDS alerts to</p>

    <p>Detect exploit paths in use by attacker</p>
    <p>Forensic evaluation  Guides analyst by highlighting other resources the attacker may have compromised</p>

    <p>Scalability Testing  Generated networks with 5 to 2500 machines</p>
    <p>Largest network took 1.5 hours to analyze on a quad-core Xeon 2.33GHz system</p>
    <p>Smallest network took approximately 1 second</p>
    <p>Larger networks have more complex attack graphs, so they take longer to analyze even with clustering and abstract exploit templates</p>
