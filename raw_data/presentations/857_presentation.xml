    <p>Related Work</p>
    <p>Trace analysis  Numerous publications</p>
    <p>Most closely related is Patterson [2002]</p>
    <p>Snapshots  Common paradigm for storage but rarely integrated with</p>
    <p>incremental transfer techniques</p>
    <p>Storage overheads Azagury [2002] and Shah [2006]</p>
    <p>Synchronous Mirroring  Effective when change rates are low and geographic</p>
    <p>distance is small</p>
    <p>We are focused on periodic, asynchronous replication</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Trace analysis shows diversity of storage characteristics</p>
    <p>Snapshot overheads on primary storage can be decreased by improved integration with network transfer</p>
    <p>Sequential versus random access patterns affect incremental change patterns on both primary and protection storage</p>

    <p>A write buffer decreases snapshot I/O overheads but has little impact on storage overheads</p>
    <p>40% of written bytes are transferred to protection storage</p>
    <p>Schedule at least 6 hours between transfers to minimize clean data in transferred blocks</p>
    <p>Schedule at least 12 hours between transfers to minimize peak network bandwidth requirements</p>
