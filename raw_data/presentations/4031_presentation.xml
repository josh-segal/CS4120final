  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivating our investigation</p>
    <p>Traffic Lights Ubiquitous critical infrastructure</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High-level overview of our findings</p>
    <p>We evaluated an existing anonymous traffic infrastructure deployment We discovered numerous issues with the system</p>
    <p>Both the road agency and vendors at fault The real issue:</p>
    <p>An absence of security consciousness in the field</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Outline</p>
    <p>Anatomy of a traffic intersection</p>
    <p>Security evaluation</p>
    <p>Recommendations</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>How vehicles are detected</p>
    <p>&gt; 80% of intersections detect vehicles Inductive sensors</p>
    <p>Wired and wireless Video detection Microwave, Radar, Ultrasonic, etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Inside the traffic cabinet</p>
    <p>Malfunction Management Unit (MMU)</p>
    <p>Traffic Controller</p>
    <p>Light Relays</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Malfunction Management Unit</p>
    <p>Electrical failsafe Hand-soldered configuration card</p>
    <p>Physical connections Whitelist of valid states</p>
    <p>Invalid states trigger an override</p>
    <p>Goes to blinking red lights Requires manual reset</p>
    <p>Stops 4-way green lights</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Other intersection hardware</p>
    <p>Radio communication Between controllers Back to main server</p>
    <p>Video cameras</p>
    <p>Remote inspection</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Overview of deployment</p>
    <p>Collaborated with a road agency Urban area Approximately 100 lights total</p>
    <p>Provided hardware for testing and access to deployment</p>
    <p>Initial testing all performed under a laboratory setting As a condition of their involvement:</p>
    <p>Wish to remain anonymous and keep vendors anonymous</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Deployment wireless network</p>
    <p>Lights networked in a tree Single private network Data reporting only</p>
    <p>Two communication bands</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Findings  900 MHz radios</p>
    <p>No encryption enabled on connections Relies on proprietary protocol and frequency hopping WPA is possible</p>
    <p>Default username and password in use Vendor configuration software</p>
    <p>Requires default username and password to function</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Findings - 5.8 GHz radios</p>
    <p>Proprietary protocol Similar to 802.11  still broadcasts an SSID Network name can be found on a standard laptop</p>
    <p>Traffic Light #1 Traffic Light #2</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Findings - 5.8 GHz radios</p>
    <p>No encryption enabled on connections Relies on proprietary protocol WPA2 is possible</p>
    <p>Default username and password in use Vendor configuration software</p>
    <p>Allows password to be changed Assumes single password in use throughout deployment</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Connecting to the network</p>
    <p>How difficult is it? 1. Purchase 5.8 GHz radio from same vendor 2. Open laptop and find network SSID 3. Enter SSID into radio configuration as roaming slave</p>
    <p>Network access at any point allows communication with all traffic light controllers in the deployment</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Findings  Traffic controller</p>
    <p>Usually controlled physically from the front panel No username or password by default Access control can be enabled, but is not simple</p>
    <p>FTP server with database file for settings</p>
    <p>Unchangeable default username and password</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Findings  Traffic controller</p>
    <p>Runs VxWorks real-time operating system Default build leaves a debug port open Controller we tested was vulnerable Arbitrary access to read and write memory</p>
    <p>Actually, the vendor had already fixed this issue The patch report didnt mention it Road agency hadnt gotten around to updating controllers</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Findings  Traffic controller</p>
    <p>NTCIP 1202 National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol Standard defining communications for traffic controllers SNMP can be used to manage devices Does not provide protection from unauthorized access</p>
    <p>Vendor program for remote controller interaction</p>
    <p>Uses NTCIP 1202 to emulate front panel interactions Easy to sniff with Wireshark</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Controlling the controller</p>
    <p>We created a library of commands based on vendor program Arrow keys, Number keys, Main Menu button</p>
    <p>We then created a C program to act as a traffic controller shell</p>
    <p>Can manually change settings on the controller Can also run scripts to automatically perform actions Advance lights Freeze lights Trigger MMU</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Putting it all together</p>
    <p>We can now: Access the network Connect to the controller Change light states</p>
    <p>Next, we wanted to try it out at a real light</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Demonstration on Deployment</p>
    <p>T-intersection MMU defaults to blinking</p>
    <p>yellows on main road Required supplies</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Demonstration on Deployment</p>
    <p>Connected to network Ran controller shell Changed light on command Also accidentally triggered MMU twice</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What can an attacker really do?</p>
    <p>Denial of service Its easy to trigger the MMU to take over Requires a technician to manually reset the device</p>
    <p>Traffic congestion</p>
    <p>Possible to change timings such that a road becomes backed up Individual light control</p>
    <p>Speedy getaways just like the movies</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Recommendations for road agencies</p>
    <p>Follow basic security best practices Need to enable encryption</p>
    <p>Proprietary protocols do not cut it Hiding SSIDs is a good idea Add firewalls to block access to ports you arent using Keep firmware up to date</p>
    <p>Change default usernames and passwords</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Recommendations for vendors</p>
    <p>Enforce security Require strong wireless security options Allow and expect usernames and passwords to be changed Somebody needs to be thinking about security</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Vendor Response</p>
    <p>Traffic controller vendor responded: The company has followed the accepted industry standard and it is</p>
    <p>that standard which does not include security</p>
    <p>Worrying for future Vehicle-to-Vehicle/Infrastructure technologies</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Concluding Remarks</p>
    <p>The real problem here is a lack of security consciousness Traffic lights underwent a phase change</p>
    <p>Timing electronics to computerized systems Standalone devices to wireless networks Security did not keep up</p>
    <p>Ensuring security of critical infrastructure should be a top priority</p>
