    <p>Mobile computing as a disruptive force</p>
    <p>First wave of mobile computing:</p>
    <p>Voice was king</p>
    <p>Second wave of mobile computing:</p>
    <p>Computer is king</p>
    <p>Platform thinking  similar to desktop and laptop</p>
    <p>Challenges the inherited mobile systems infrastructure</p>
    <p>Challenge: Develop the next-generation mobile computing infrastructure</p>
    <p>Background</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges</p>
    <p>Disclaimers:</p>
    <p>These four challenges are not independent</p>
    <p>Other challenges exist</p>
    <p>Some challenges are well-known, and now re-emerging</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Robustness challenge: In wireless networks, the physical medium is generally</p>
    <p>dynamic,</p>
    <p>variable in reliability, and</p>
    <p>devices can and do move.</p>
    <p>Impact of Platform Thinking:</p>
    <p>Robustness Challenge</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Responsiveness challenge: With the growth in mobile consumption of streaming media</p>
    <p>desire to balance competing needs of different traffic flows against fixed resources</p>
    <p>revived interest in mechanisms to externally control an otherwise static network (e.g., SDN) and policies that enforce rational resource allocation</p>
    <p>real-time resource allocation is a necessity, but current operator practice treats it as a static problem</p>
    <p>Impact of Platform Thinking:</p>
    <p>Responsiveness Challenge</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Power challenge: The competitive nature of mobile app marketplaces taxes the power usage of mobile phones</p>
    <p>rapid evolution of on-phone computing performance and app capabilities</p>
    <p>mobile phone must operate at or below the so-called ``three watt limit, else it gets too hot to handle</p>
    <p>minimize the time a mobile device is tethered for charging</p>
    <p>Impact of Platform Thinking:</p>
    <p>Power Challenge</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>App development challenge: mobile apps often consist of developer's code + some cloud service</p>
    <p>IP packets traveling mobile-to-cloud or mobile-to-mobile transit extensive wireless edge and core networks to reach their destinations: Latency is often a problem</p>
    <p>few developers know how to statically divide an app for power optimization</p>
    <p>depending on partitioning, power-cost of computing and communication will change, possibly drastically</p>
    <p>inherently unknown nature of app's input-dependent behavior makes static partitioning unrealistic</p>
    <p>Impact of Platform Thinking:</p>
    <p>App Development Challenge</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Apps expose desired network resource allocation (bandwidth, maximum latency):</p>
    <p>Network conducts auctions to set prices and priorities</p>
    <p>Feedback loop is closed when the apps receive results of the auction and modify their requests accordingly</p>
    <p>Network operator maximizes revenue</p>
    <p>Apps and networks jointly do power management:</p>
    <p>App instances are running on millions of devices, they provide meta-data for state of wireless connections</p>
    <p>Learn network-dependent power behavior: Correlate power usage with signal strength across many apps</p>
    <p>Video streaming app: weak signal triggers use of a codec that minimizes retransmissions, minimizing wasted power</p>
    <p>Whats Next?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Power management: the most pressing issue in mobile app creation and mobility computing?</p>
    <p>Power usage can be:</p>
    <p>measured across different, concurrent app instances</p>
    <p>these measurements can then be correlated with network measurements and models</p>
    <p>Machine learning and system identification can be then be done used for feedback control:</p>
    <p>setpoint would be power consumption</p>
    <p>the control actions would be to dynamically migrate parts of an app between the device and the cloud</p>
    <p>Compared to previous research [Chen 2012, Thiagarajan 2012], we propose to automatically partition a broader class of apps</p>
