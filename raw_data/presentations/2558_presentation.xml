    <p>Nash Equilibria in Symmetric Games</p>
    <p>Nash equilibria in symmetric games</p>
    <p>Every (strongly) symmetric game has a symmetric equilibrium (Nash, 1951)</p>
    <p>Symmetric equilibrium can be computed in P if |A| = O(log |N|/ log log |N|) (Papadimitriou and Roughgarden, 2005)</p>
    <p>Does not apply to pure equilibria or weak symmetry</p>
    <p>Not obvious that symmetry simplifies the search for equilibria</p>

    <p>(1,1,1) (0, 0, 0)</p>
    <p>(0,1,0) (0, 0, 0)</p>

    <p>Weak Symmetry/Anonymity, |A| = O(1) Membership in TC0</p>
    <p>Fix a particular x = #(s), s  AN , and do the following:</p>
    <p>Step 1 involves checking the Nash equilibrium condition</p>
    <p>Step 2 reduces to a homologous flow problem</p>
    <p>Constant |A|  Constant number of subsets C  x takes only polynomially many different values</p>
    <p>Certainly in P; membership in TC0 can be shown by exploiting the structure of the flow network</p>

    <p>m + 2 players of two different types</p>
    <p>Type of player i depends on value of i th input bit, players m + 1 and m + 2 are of of type 0 and 1, respectively</p>

    <p>Strong Symmetry/Anonymity, |A| = O(1)</p>
    <p>Unlike weak symmetry/anonymity: if s is a Nash equilibrium, so are all t with #(t) = #(s)</p>
    <p>We only need to check best response property for player playing a certain action, of which there are at most |A|</p>
    <p>Again, #(s), s  AN takes only polynomially many different values</p>
    <p>Strongly anonymous games are common payoff; finding the maximum payoff (in AC0) even finds a social welfare maximizing Nash equilibrium</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Four notions of symmetry in multi-player games</p>
    <p>Finding pure Nash equilibria is tractable if the number of actions is a constant</p>
    <p>Identical payoff functions for all players simplify the problem</p>
    <p>A growing number of actions makes it intractable</p>
    <p>Anonymity seems to have no influence on the complexity</p>

    <p>distinguished</p>
