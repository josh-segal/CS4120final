    <p>Outline!</p>
    <p>! Motivation</p>
    <p>! Californias Tallying Process</p>
    <p>! Methodology</p>
    <p>! Findings</p>
    <p>! Security</p>
    <p>! Transparency</p>
    <p>! Efficiency</p>

    <p>Checking the Math!</p>
    <p>! If we cant get the access and oversight support we need, what then? Audit.</p>
    <p>! By audit, we compare two sets of software-independent records</p>
    <p>! 38 states keep independent records</p>
    <p>! Only 17 actually count them</p>
    <p>High-Level: What to Audit?!</p>
    <p>! Post-election auditing lit. has exploded</p>
    <p>! Brennan Center / Samuelson Clinic convened a blue ribbon panel</p>
    <p>! Examined:</p>
    <p>! Fixed-percentage audits</p>
    <p>! Margin-dependent audits (tiered and non-)</p>
    <p>! Polling audits</p>
    <p>! Margin-dependent audits with a floor.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Low-Level: How to Audit?!</p>
    <p>! CA has had manual tallies since 1965.</p>
    <p>! Very little is prescribed by election law</p>
    <p>! Tally must compare ballots in 1% of precincts</p>
    <p>! Must be randomly chosen and completed before the canvass is over (28 cal. days)</p>
    <p>! Must include all types of ballots</p>
    <p>! We set out with a group of researchers to improve the security, efficiency and transparency of CAs manual count.</p>

    <p>! Precincts chosen randomly</p>
    <p>! Materials are retrieved, verified, sorted</p>
    <p>! Typically four people perform tally: Caller, Witness and two Talliers</p>
    <p>! Use a tally sheet and announce 10s</p>
    <p>! Hand tally is compared to electronic</p>
    <p>! Discrepancies must be reconciled</p>
    <p>How Does the Tally Work?!</p>

    <p>Methodology!</p>
    <p>! Examine existing procedures for the tally</p>
    <p>! Worked with San Mateo in-depth</p>
    <p>! Iteratively developed new procedures</p>
    <p>! San Mateo used our interim procedures</p>
    <p>! Observed tally process in San Mateo as well as Alameda and Marin.</p>
    <p>! Revised and generalized procedures such that any CA county can use them.</p>
    <p>Findings: Security!</p>
    <p>! Selection and tally must take place after ballots are counted</p>
    <p>! Tally should take place soon after selection and seals verified</p>
    <p>! Counting must be blind (not too blind)</p>
    <p>! Certain procedures need expert review when revised</p>
    <p>! Tally process should be resistant to insider attacks</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Findings: Transparency!</p>
    <p>! Provide public notice of the tally</p>
    <p>! Publish tally procedures</p>
    <p>! Publish useful data, digital &amp; hardcopy</p>
    <p>! Ensure clear lines of communication for observers</p>
    <p>! Randomness w/ dice can be inefficient</p>
    <p>! Electronic results need to be fine-grained</p>
    <p>! Adverse effects of good team demeanor</p>
    <p>! Pre-fill tally sheets</p>
    <p>! Consider using RFIDs to ease pressure on chain-of-custody.</p>
    <p>Findings: Efficiency!</p>
