    <p>Guarantee:  Query answer on neighboring databases are very similar.</p>
    <p>We can view  as a privacy budget:  The total amount of privacy we are willing to release.  Each query uses up some budget.  Refuse further queries once budget is depleted.</p>

    <p>Do we have enough budget?  Can we detect attacks with noised data?  What about compromised PRISM nodes?  Does PRISM provide privacy for ISPs, too?  Would PRISM work with a partial deployment?  Can we make all queries differentially private?  Would PRISMs query processor scale?</p>

    <p>The privacy budget</p>
    <p>Admin can set their own privacy budget .  Differential privacy is composable:</p>
    <p>Two queries with budget 1 and 2 costs the same with one query with budget (1+2).</p>
    <p>PRISM continues answering queries until  runs out.  Estimation of number of queries: noised answer is within E of the</p>
    <p>true answer with probability c.</p>

    <p>2    ln(1  )</p>
    <p>The budget problem:  sets a hard limit on how many queries PRISM can answer.</p>
    <p>Many ways to set  [e.g., Hsu-CSF-2013]  No matter how large, budget eventually runs out.</p>
