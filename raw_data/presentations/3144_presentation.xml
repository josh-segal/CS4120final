    <p>The online ad ecosystem</p>

    <p>Threats  Simple threats: script-based page retrieval</p>
    <p>Ubiquitous - $12/10K impressions  Mechanical turk</p>
    <p>Humans who are paid (or requested) to access sites  More complex threats: botnets</p>
    <p>Geotargeting, clicks, and other characteristics  As much as $100/10K impressions</p>
    <p>New threats: pay-per-view networks  Websites that load 3rd party pages in an obfuscated</p>
    <p>fashion when accessed by users</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Web traffic generation  Search is the original form of traffic generation</p>
    <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is a popular service</p>
    <p>Legitimate forms of traffic generation  Adwords  Content widgets (e.g., OutBrain)</p>
    <p>Type purchase web traffic in Google search  MANY traffic generation offerings  Wide variety of features (geo, uniques, etc.)</p>
    <p>Investigation of 34 target sites  Assurance that no black hat methods are used  Great deal of repackaging and ambiguous DNS registrations</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Honeypot websites</p>
    <p>Series of websites developed to be targets for traffic generation  Look and feel of a</p>
    <p>real site</p>
    <p>Instrumentation  Gather as much data</p>
    <p>per access as possible</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Case study traffic purchases</p>
    <p>Vendor Amount Runtime Price</p>
    <p>MaxVisits 10,000 5 days $11.99</p>
    <p>BuildTraffic 20,000 60 days $55.00</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Purchased traffic observations</p>
    <p>69K out of the 110K purchased impressions were delivered  BuildTraffic ended 28 days into its 60 day cycle  AeTraffic is still delivering at a low level  BuyBulkVisitor delivered 1 impression</p>
    <p>Tiny (1%) overlap with public IP blacklists  Virtually no interactions on our site  Only modest reuse of IP addresses  Inconsistent ad loads  Most traffic was from pop-unders</p>
    <p>Only 53% of view had non-zero frame size</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>PPV networks</p>
    <p>Traffic generation objective: look like a real user (and offer features at low price)</p>
    <p>Some TG services offer a simple tag that when included on a site pays attractive CPM  will not block any of your site content and</p>
    <p>does not lead to actions where users might be led to leave your site</p>
    <p>Tag will display 3rd party websites</p>
    <p>PPV network: groups of sites that run tags from a single TG service</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Deep dive into PPV nets  When a user accesses a site running a PPV</p>
    <p>tag a pop-under window is generated  Typically requires a user action</p>
    <p>Pop-under calls PPV network server  Delivers details on user and site</p>
    <p>PPV network will deliver URLs of sites buying traffic  Often to 0 height frames  Frequent reloads</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Scope of PPV nets</p>
    <p>Many PPV sites publish their volume  Average of 17.16M unique visitors and 6.29B page</p>
    <p>views per provider per day are claimed</p>
    <p>We identified 10 candidate PPV tags from review of purchased traffic and online forums</p>
    <p>We searched Jan-June 12 Common Crawl DB for publisher sites that run PPV tags from 10 providers  Javascript checked for pop-under generation</p>
    <p>Over 4M PPV tags found on over 11K domains  Largest: ero-advertising.com on 5.8K domains</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Impact of PPV nets</p>
    <p>MuStats used to estimate daily page views on identified pages (domains and subdomains)  Over 168M estimated daily page views</p>
    <p>Assumptions  25% of pop-unders are blocked  4 destination sites per pop-under  Destination sites run 4 ads @ $0.25 CPM</p>
    <p>Over $15M/month in wasted ad spend from 10 PPV networks alone!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Mitigating PPV nets  Viewport size filters</p>
    <p>Advertisers or intermediaries that run ad servers can augment their Javascript to check viewport</p>
    <p>Would filter 46% of impressions in our data</p>
    <p>Referrer blacklist  Block traffic originating from PPV networks  Would block 99% of our purchased traffic</p>
    <p>Publisher blacklist  Identify publishers that participate in PPV nets  Block ad requests from those publishers  Would discourage publishers from PPV nets</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Summary and status  Fraud is a huge problem in online advertising</p>
    <p>From simple scripts to sophisticated bots to PPV networks</p>
    <p>Ongoing honeypot-based data gathering  m.Labs has developed TQ platform to identify</p>
    <p>fraud  m.Labs open experimental platform</p>
    <p>Data repository and API for ad fraud detection</p>
    <p>New directions for data gathering and fraud analysis</p>
