    <p>Why to study DNS Query Failures</p>
    <p>Failures prevent access to any services dependent on domain names</p>
    <p>High-level observation: 13.5% of DNS queries fail</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>LDNS</p>
    <p>end users anonymized IP address, BGP prefix, ASN, recursive resolvers IP address, DNS query type, resource records, timestamp</p>
    <p>Passive DNS Data</p>
    <p>14-day samples (each sample consists of 10-minute logs) , ~3.1 billion logs</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Identification of Failed Queries</p>
    <p>No RCODE: we turn to a heuristic method to filter out logs that are attributed to NXDOMAINs</p>
    <p>Check if the requested domain (QNAME) contains a valid answer  e.g., for an A query, at least one RR in the response is an A record of the QNAME</p>
    <p>Extract failed queries of the four most popular types of records that constitute 99.5% of all queries</p>
    <p>Filter out logs attributed to NXDOMAINs by removing logs containing domains that have never succeeded in the whole dataset</p>
    <p>2.8 billion logs remain for subsequent analyses</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>A Primer on DNS Failures</p>
    <p>A queries account for the majority and are successfully resolved most frequently</p>
    <p>Other query types manifest lower success rates  Surprisingly low success rate for AAAA queries</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Failures Across Domains</p>
    <p>A queries exhibit high success rates  Nevertheless, as many as 7% of domains experience a success rate &lt;50%</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Failures Across Domains</p>
    <p>AAAA queries: ~60% domains have never been successfully resolved  Infrastructural limitations in how DNS supports IPv6</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Failures Across Domains</p>
    <p>The concentrate of failures on a small set of domains</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Failures Across Domains</p>
    <p>For most categories, &gt;80% of the failures are attributed to the top 3 SLDs  Some domain types are paramount in increasing failure rates</p>

    <p>Failures Across Resolvers</p>
    <p>The majority of resolvers serving A queries have very high success rates</p>

    <p>Failures Across TLDs  Specifically explore two camps of TLDs</p>
    <p>The new generic Top Level Domains  Those that have Internationalized Domain Name</p>
    <p>They show lower success rates, maybe because  Such gTLDs attract certain types of domain registrant  The presence of malicious domains which are unreliable</p>

  <div class="page">

    <p>The majority of domains map to a relatively small set of prefixes</p>

    <p>Such an active measurement system is useful for content publishers, ISPs and end users</p>
    <p>For publishers  help locate their content</p>
    <p>For ISPs  help estimate the IPv6 traffic</p>
    <p>For users  help to choose more suitable resolvers</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Implications on Systems Design</p>
    <p>Extracting features from domain names may not work well for detecting malicious new gTLD domains</p>
    <p>To build a malicious new gTLD domain detection system, we could use features like</p>
    <p>DNS query frequency  the number of FQDNs of an SLD  the resolved IP addresses  the corresponding ASes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Findings: based on analysis using passive DNS logs covering over 3B queries from 3 ISPs in China</p>
    <p>A small number of domains are responsible for the majority of failures  Domains and resolvers need to be upgraded for better IPv6 support  Diverse failure rates across the DNS resolvers  New gTLDs have higher failure rates largely because of malicious domains</p>
    <p>Implications: we propose two potential systems that could build on our findings</p>
    <p>Active measurement system  Malicious new gTLD domain detection system</p>
