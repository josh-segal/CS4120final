    <p>SUMMARY</p>
    <p>Translation does not distorts the original text randomly</p>
    <p>A phylogenetic language tree can be reconstructed from monolingual texts translated from various languages</p>
    <p>Translations impact the evolution of languages</p>
    <p>It is estimated that for It is estimated that for It is estimated that for It is estimated that for certain languages up to certain languages up to certain languages up to certain languages up to 30303030% of % of % of % of published texts published texts published texts published texts are are are are mediated through translations mediated through translations mediated through translations mediated through translations ((((Pym and Pym and Pym and Pym and ChrupaaChrupaaChrupaaChrupaa, , , , 2005200520052005))))</p>
    <p>Are translations likely to play a role in language change?</p>
    <p>Features associated with interference (POS-ngrams, FWs) yield more accurate phylogenetic language trees</p>
