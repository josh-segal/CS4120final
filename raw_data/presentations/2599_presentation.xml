    <p>Figure 3: Factors that impact communication throughput.</p>
    <p>While energy harvesting rate might seem like a characteristic of the harvesting source, system parameters have a surprisingly high impact. Figure 3(a) shows the empirically measured harvesting rate as we vary the amount of time for which the node replenishes energy between two transmissions. The results are counter-intuitive  while one might expect more energy to be harvested over time, the harvesting rate drops to zero for longer sleep durations.</p>
    <p>This observation can be explained analytically by looking at how capacitors buffer energy. The charging process of a capacitor follows its charging equation V = Vmax(1  ets/t ), where ts is the sleep time, t is the RC circuit time constant, and Vmax is the maximum voltage to which the capacitor can be charged under the current harvesting conditions. Its energy harvesting rate follows the equation: H = C V 2max  t1(1  ets/t )ets/t . When the harvesting conditions are constant (i.e. Vmax and t are fixed), H is a concave function of ts, which is shown both analytically and empirically in Figure 3(a). When harvesting conditions change, both Vmax and t change, therefore the maximum operating point changes as well. Thus, to optimize throughput, it is important to adapt to current harvesting conditions, and continually track the maximum harvesting point.</p>
    <p>One factor that should not be overlooked is keeping the overhead of adaptation low. Most methods to track the charging rate of batteries and capacitors use analogto-digital conversions to obtain the voltage at the energy reservoir. This overhead is minuscule for most platforms, but a significant part of the harvested energy in our case. Thus, it is important to minimize such overheads while adapting to harvesting conditions.</p>
    <p>Challenge 3: Time-decaying SNR A peculiar aspect of backscatter communication is that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the received signal at the reader degrades steadily as the size of the transmission unit increases. Figure 3(b) shows that the signal strength of a node response decreases gradually from 0.18 at 1.5ms to 0.05 at 8ms during the transmission process. While decoding the initial part of the transmission is straightforward due</p>
    <p>to high SNR, it becomes much more challenging after about 8ms since the SNR is too low for reliable decoding, resulting in packet losses.</p>
    <p>In order to understand why this happens, let us look at how a backscatter radio works. A backscatter radio provides power to a passive device and enables communication. The reader provides a carrier wave, which can be reflected by a passive device back to the reader with its own information bits. The modulation is achieved by toggling the state of the transistor of a backscatter device shown in Figure 3(c). Since the same RF power source is shared by different system components, some fraction of the incoming power is used to operate the micro-powered device while the rest is reflected back to the reader for communication. The exact fraction depends on the state of the energy reservoir C and the state of the matching circuit, which is designed to charge the energy reservoir C when the voltage is low. Therefore, when the transmission begins, C is fully charged, the antenna resistance is mismatched with the resistance of other hardware components of the system. As a result, most of the incoming power will be reflected back to the reader, which receives a strong signal that can be easily decoded. As the transfer progresses, C slowly discharges, and the antenna resistance matches the resistance of the system load. Therefore, most of the incoming power is harvested to operate the system, and less RF power is reflected. This leads to decreased backscatter signal strength at the reader, and consequently, packet losses. Thus, to ensure that packets are received successfully, the tag needs to adapt the size of each packet such that the SNR at the tail of the packet is higher than the minimum decoding requirement.</p>
    <p>Challenge 4: Energy-induced reader to node losses While time-decaying SNR only presents a problem when a node communicates with a reader, reader to node communication presents other challenges. The central issue is that that the energy level on the receiving node might dip below the low watermark at any point during the reception, at which point the node has to shut off its RF circuit and go to sleep to recharge. The reader, however, does not know that the node has gone to sleep, and only</p>

    <p>QuarkNet enables a network stack to seamlessly scale down to severe energy harvesting conditions.</p>
    <p>- Maximum operational range 21 feet, 3.5x higher than Dewdrop.</p>

    <p>QuarkNet addresses a fundamental limitation of backscatter, which is operating range, and simultaneously</p>

    <p>Key contribution is a novel packet fragmentation abstraction that can scale down to frame sizes as small as a few bits</p>

Figure 3(a) shows the empirically measured harvesting rate as we vary the amount of time for which the node replenishes energy between two transmissions. The results are counter-intuitive  while one might expect more energy to be harvested over time, the harvesting rate drops to zero for longer sleep durations.</p>
    <p>This observation can be explained analytically by looking at how capacitors buffer energy. The charging process of a capacitor follows its charging equation V = Vmax(1  ets/t ), where ts is the sleep time, t is the RC circuit time constant, and Vmax is the maximum voltage to which the capacitor can be charged under the current harvesting conditions. Its energy harvesting rate follows the equation: H = C V 2max  t1(1  ets/t )ets/t . When the harvesting conditions are constant (i.e. Vmax and t are fixed), H is a concave function of ts, which is shown both analytically and empirically in Figure 3(a). When harvesting conditions change, both Vmax and t change, therefore the maximum operating point changes as well. Thus, to optimize throughput, it is important to adapt to current harvesting conditions, and continually track the maximum harvesting point.</p>
    <p>One factor that should not be overlooked is keeping the overhead of adaptation low. Most methods to track the charging rate of batteries and capacitors use analogto-digital conversions to obtain the voltage at the energy reservoir. This overhead is minuscule for most platforms, but a significant part of the harvested energy in our case. Thus, it is important to minimize such overheads while adapting to harvesting conditions.</p>
    <p>Challenge 3: Time-decaying SNR A peculiar aspect of backscatter communication is that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the received signal at the reader degrades steadily as the size of the transmission unit increases. Figure 3(b) shows that the signal strength of a node response decreases gradually from 0.18 at 1.5ms to 0.05 at 8ms during the transmission process. While decoding the initial part of the transmission is straightforward due</p>
    <p>to high SNR, it becomes much more challenging after about 8ms since the SNR is too low for reliable decoding, resulting in packet losses.</p>
    <p>In order to understand why this happens, let us look at how a backscatter radio works. A backscatter radio provides power to a passive device and enables communication. The reader provides a carrier wave, which can be reflected by a passive device back to the reader with its own information bits. The modulation is achieved by toggling the state of the transistor of a backscatter device shown in Figure 3(c). Since the same RF power source is shared by different system components, some fraction of the incoming power is used to operate the micro-powered device while the rest is reflected back to the reader for communication. The exact fraction depends on the state of the energy reservoir C and the state of the matching circuit, which is designed to charge the energy reservoir C when the voltage is low. Therefore, when the transmission begins, C is fully charged, the antenna resistance is mismatched with the resistance of other hardware components of the system. As a result, most of the incoming power will be reflected back to the reader, which receives a strong signal that can be easily decoded. As the transfer progresses, C slowly discharges, and the antenna resistance matches the resistance of the system load. Therefore, most of the incoming power is harvested to operate the system, and less RF power is reflected. This leads to decreased backscatter signal strength at the reader, and consequently, packet losses. Thus, to ensure that packets are received successfully, the tag needs to adapt the size of each packet such that the SNR at the tail of the packet is higher than the minimum decoding requirement.</p>
    <p>Challenge 4: Energy-induced reader to node losses While time-decaying SNR only presents a problem when a node communicates with a reader, reader to node communication presents other challenges. The central issue is that that the energy level on the receiving node might dip below the low watermark at any point during the reception, at which point the node has to shut off its RF circuit and go to sleep to recharge. The reader, however, does not know that the node has gone to sleep, and only</p>
