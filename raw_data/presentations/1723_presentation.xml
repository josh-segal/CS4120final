    <p>Cameras can have benefits for nannies</p>
    <p>Expectations and Attitudes</p>
    <p>Maybe if the kids lie and say that you did something, [...] you can say, Well, let's see the cameras. (N24)</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Views often depend on the purpose of the camera(s)</p>
    <p>High level: Targeting nanny or for other purposes</p>
    <p>Focus on Purposes and Intentions</p>
    <p>If the cameras were specifically put in place to watch me, it would make me more uncomfortable than if it was just [...] security cameras, [...] or its just the monitor for the baby. (N33)</p>

    <p>Focus on Purposes and Intentions</p>
    <p>[If] I knew that they were watching me throughout the day, as opposed to just quickly forwarding through the video at night to make sure nothing happens, that would make a huge difference. (N33)</p>

    <p>Camera use says something about employer-employee relationships</p>
    <p>What are their intentions? Do they trust me?</p>
    <p>Focus on Purposes and Intentions</p>
    <p>I think I would start to [...] question that theyre trusting me [...] or honestly if its just a matter of them wanting to see what happens in the house during the day. (N37)</p>

    <p>Very few discussions about whether cameras are okay</p>

    <p>Cameras and Power Dynamics</p>
    <p>Its like, we're telling you you have cameras but you have no other right to know what else gets done. I'm still not as comfortable being forthright and asking, like, Does it record voice, or does it do this, or does it do that? (N16)</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Very few discussions about whether cameras are okay</p>
    <p>Few discussions about locations, privacy settings, etc.</p>
    <p>Its the parents decision because:</p>
    <p>Its their house</p>
    <p>Its their kids</p>
    <p>Theyre the bosses</p>
    <p>Cameras and Power Dynamics</p>
    <p>Not only are they your boss, [its] their house, they're allowed to do what they want. So, saying No [...] Yeah, therere probably going to be consequences for that. (N33)</p>
