    <p>RELATED WORK  Demanding jobs require attention, memory, and visual perception [7]  High workload increases likelihood of errors, decreases performance [14]  Burnout linked to mental exhaustion from stress [21]  Shift work and hours worked contributed to high stress and burnout in cyber</p>
    <p>warfare operators [3]  Vigilance for (simulated) cyber events consistent with air traffic control [20]  Stress from urgency to respond and hyper vigilance involved from not wanting to</p>
