    <p>Context</p>
    <p>Game theory: Mathematical study of behavior in idealized strategic multiagent settings.</p>
    <p>Idealized agents, not human agents.  Behavioral game theory: Aims to extend game theory to</p>
    <p>modelling human agents.  There are a wide range of BGT models in the literature.  BGT focuses on explaining behavior rather than predicting it.  Not much work compares different models predictive power.</p>

    <p>Game theory: Normal form game</p>
    <p>In a normal form game:</p>
    <p>Each agent simultaneously chooses an action from a finite action set.</p>
    <p>Each combination of actions yields a known utility to each agent.</p>
    <p>The agents may choose actions either deterministically or stochastically.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Nash equilibrium</p>
    <p>In a Nash equilibrium, each agent best responds to the others.  An agent best responds to other agents actions by choosing a</p>
    <p>strategy that maximizes utility, conditional on the other agents strategies.</p>

    <p>Modifications to a game that dont change Nash equilibrium predictions at all can cause large changes in how human subjects play the game [Goeree &amp; Holt 2001].</p>
