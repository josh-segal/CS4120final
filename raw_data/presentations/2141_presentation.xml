    <p>Power Throttling</p>
    <p>Power throttling : power is automatically decreased at the overheating points to control heat output</p>

    <p>Is simply decreasing power good enough?</p>

    <p>Significant performance degradation at the overheating points  Protection mechanism throttles power by reducing active resources  Reduced power lowers temperature, but also limits active resources  Overheating problem and power throttling issue hinder SSDs from</p>

    <p>HW/SW optimization studies are required to improve power and energy efficiency of SSDs</p>
