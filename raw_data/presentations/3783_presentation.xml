    <p>One idea: Inactivity based withdrawal Automatically withdraw content only when it is inactive</p>
    <p>Inactive content: no interaction (e.g., retweets) for time T</p>
    <p>In other words No tweet receiving recent interaction will be withdrawn</p>

    <p>Summary Analyzed longitudinal exposure control from recent to very far past</p>
    <p>Users control exposure by withdrawing surprisingly large amount of old data First study to analyze information leakage via residual activities</p>
    <p>They leak significant information about withdrawn content Inactivity based withdrawal is an approach to stop information leakage from residual activities and facilitate interaction</p>
