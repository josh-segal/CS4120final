    <p>Voting Trees</p>
    <p>I A procedure for choosing from a tournament I Voting tree  on A : Binary tree with elements of A at the leaves I Given tournament T , label each internal node with the label of</p>
    <p>its children that is better according to T I Label at the root is the winner, denoted (T ) I Question: Which solutions can be implemented by voting trees? I  implements f if for any T T(A ), (T )  f (T )</p>
    <p>I Copeland solution can be implemented if and only if m  7 (Moulin, 1986; Srivastava and Trick, 1996)</p>
    <p>I Question: Can the Copeland solution be approximated?</p>

    <p>I Trivial for non-admissible randomizations, random alternative has expected degree m12</p>

    <p>Proof Outline</p>
    <p>I k -RC is close to an admissible distribution I Equivalent to a random walk on the tournament</p>

    <p>I Look at reversibilization M of the transition matrix I Fill (1991): 4(k ) 2  m(1(M))k , where 1(M) is the</p>
    <p>second largest eigenvalue of M I Sinclair and Jerrum (1989): 1  2  1(A )  1</p>

    <p>I This counterexample is generic, so we either get 12 w.h.p. or something better in expectation</p>

    <p>What We (Dont) Know</p>
    <p>I Permutation tree: balanced tree, every alternative at one leaf I Trivial (deterministic) lower bound of ( log mm ) I Large gap between this and the upper bound of 34 I Balanced trees of height (log m) + 1 do not help I Composition of permutation trees cannot do better than 12</p>
    <p>I Randomized model: gap between 12 and 5 6</p>
    <p>I Randomized balanced trees oscillate, dont provide any bound I Higher-order caterpillars also oscillate</p>
