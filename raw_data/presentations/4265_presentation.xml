    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>User attribute prediction from text is successful:</p>
    <p>I Age (Rao et al. 2010 ACL) I Gender (Burger et al. 2011 EMNLP) I Location (Eisenstein et al. 2010 EMNLP) I Personality (Schwartz et al. 2013 PLoS One) I Impact (Lampos et al. 2014 EACL) I Political Orientation (Volkova et al. 2014 ACL) I Mental Illness (Coppersmith et al. 2014 ACL) I Occupation (Preotiuc-Pietro et al. 2015 ACL) I Income (Preotiuc-Pietro et al. 2015 PLoS One)</p>
    <p>... and useful in many applications.</p>

    <p>Political Ideology &amp; Text</p>
    <p>Hypothesis:</p>
    <p>Political ideology of a user is disclosed through language use</p>

    <p>Political Ideology &amp; Text</p>
    <p>Previous CS/NLP research used data sets with user labels identified through:</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Political Ideology &amp; Text</p>
    <p>H2 The prediction problem was so far over-simplified</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Data</p>
    <p>I Political ideology I specific of country and culture I our use case is US politics (similar to all previous work) I the major US ideology spectrum is Conservative  Liberal I seven point scale</p>

    <p>We collect a new data set:</p>

    <p>Political ideology is reported through an online survey</p>
    <p>I only way to obtain unbiased ground truth labels (Flekova et al. 2016 ACL, Carpenter et al. 2016 SPPS)</p>
