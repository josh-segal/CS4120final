    <p>What are we trying to verify?</p>
    <p>The votes were correctly counted</p>

    <p>The stack of votes in front of us was correctly counted</p>
    <p>A recount of this stack of votes wouldnt change the winner</p>
    <p>Third party verifiability: A third party with no special access can verify that a recount of this stack* of votes wouldnt change the</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Why ballot-based audits?</p>
    <p>Statistical power of an audit depends on the number of samples  Very little dependency on the size of each sample</p>
    <p>(Assuming attacker is intelligent)</p>
    <p>Traditional precinct-based audits are not very efficient</p>
    <p>Auditing individual ballots is far more efficient</p>
    <p>Independently proposed several times [CHF07, Nef03, Joh04]</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Problems with Ballot-Based Auditing</p>
    <p>Finding individual ballots is hard  Possibilities: serial numbers on ballots, hand-indexing, paper</p>
    <p>counters, weight...</p>
    <p>We need to publish the contents of each ballot (CVR or image)  Accessible to any third party</p>
    <p>The ballots are anonymous but all contents are published</p>
    <p>This allows coercion and vote buying</p>
    <p>Easiest if we publish images  Pattern voting</p>
    <p>EVT/WOTE 2009 Understanding the Security Properties of Ballot-Based Verification 7</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What about ballot images?</p>
    <p>Trivial to encode information</p>
    <p>Even valid marks can encode information  Incompletely/overfilled</p>
    <p>Could digitally sanitize  Youve just turned ballots into CVRs</p>
    <p>EVT/WOTE 2009 Understanding the Security Properties of Ballot-Based Verification 8</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The Math of Pattern Voting</p>
    <p>Basic idea: encode voter identity in downticket races  Assume results are reported by precinct</p>
    <p>Just need to identify voter within precincts  Need to encode no more than 1000-10,000 distinct identities</p>
    <p>(10-14 bits)</p>
    <p>Each contest lets us encode minimum 1-2 bits  Alice, Bob, undervote, overvote(?)</p>
    <p>10 contests is enough to encode 60,0001,000,000 identies</p>

    <p>Advantages of ETP Style Approaches</p>
    <p>Fast detection of scanner/EMS errors  Requires minimal manual intervention</p>
    <p>It already has found errors: Deck 0 bug</p>
    <p>Independent check on compromise of EMS (or scanner) by</p>
    <p>outsiders</p>
    <p>Backup for physical control of ballots  Only applies post-scanning</p>
    <p>And requires tight control of images or signing key</p>
    <p>EVT/WOTE 2009 Understanding the Security Properties of Ballot-Based Verification 11</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Does the ETP offer third party verifiability?</p>
    <p>Third parties can independently count the scanned ballots  With BallotBrowser or their own software</p>
    <p>This only detects some errors  Third parties cannot verify the ETP scanner software</p>
    <p>What if it substitutes fake ballot images?</p>
    <p>This cannot be detected by re-processing those images</p>
    <p>Checking the images requires random sampling  ... At the same level as a ballot-based audit</p>
    <p>Easiest to think of ETP checking the tabulation</p>
    <p>EVT/WOTE 2009 Understanding the Security Properties of Ballot-Based Verification 12</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Why digital signatures dont help</p>
    <p>Signatures are applied by the ETP scanning computer [Tra08]</p>
    <p>Third parties can download ballot images  And verify that they werent tampered in transit</p>
    <p>But this doesnt help if the ETP scanner is compromised  Youre getting fake ballot images that werent tampered in</p>
    <p>transit</p>
    <p>Signatures are sort of overkill here  Could just publish a message digest in a non-tamperable form</p>
    <p>(e.g., local paper)</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>Ballot-based auditing systems have far higher statistical power  But worse privacy properties (vote buying and coercion)</p>
    <p>Finding the right physical ballot is a challenge</p>
    <p>ETP provides good detection of scanner/EMS error  And some kinds of outsider attack</p>
    <p>... But requires a separate audit for third-party verifiability</p>
