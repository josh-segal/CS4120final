    <p>Building a general relational similarity model is a more efficient way to learn a model for any arbitrary relation [Turney, 2008]</p>

    <p>Binary decision on a relation loses these shades.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Problem</p>
    <p>Given a few prototypical pairs: mammal: whale, mammal:porpoise</p>
    <p>Determine which target pairs express the same relation:</p>
    <p>mammal: primate, mammal: dolphin, astronomy:stars  And to what degree:</p>
