    <p>Well-Known, Immediate Risks</p>
    <p>Traditional Information Security  Security of data</p>
    <p>Integrity of data, computation</p>
    <p>Personal privacy</p>
    <p>Malware defense</p>
    <p>Availability, reliability</p>
    <p>Important, plenty more to be done, but not what this talk is about</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>What risks might appear that we're not looking at yet/enough?</p>
    <p>Several potential risks...</p>
    <p>Acme Data, Inc. Crypto (AES, RSA, ...)</p>
    <p>VMM Protection</p>
    <p>Eviltron Passive Attacker</p>

    <p>Timing Channels</p>
    <p>The cloud exacerbates timing channel risks:</p>

    <p>In the Cloud:  providers want</p>
    <p>max usage, profit  oversubscribe</p>

    <p>But cloud computing makes this risk systemic  Control theory might help given information</p>
    <p>But incentives to keep algorithms secret  no one can analyze across providers!</p>

    <p>What risks might appear that we're not looking at yet/enough?</p>
    <p>Several potential risks...</p>

    <p>Cloud Application Provider A 99.999%</p>

    <p>Correlated Failures Already Happen</p>
    <p>Baltimore Howard Street Tunnel Fire of 2001  Cut a bundle of fibre optic cables serving</p>

    <p>A Disaster-Readiness Disaster</p>
    <p>The cloud model assumes always-connected  But in any disaster, connectedness is first to go</p>
    <p>Can't lookup CPR instructions on Wikipedia  Can't find road out of town with Maps app  Siri may be optional now, but for how long?</p>
    <p>Can't launch flashlight app or compass app</p>
    <p>What happens to search/rescue drones without their ground-based logic, operators?</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Non-Preservability of the Cloud</p>
    <p>Conventional artifacts have a decentralized preservability property  Book/music/video producers must make</p>
    <p>complete copies available to customers  Customers can work together to preserve</p>
    <p>Cloud-based artifacts destroy this property  No one but the app/service provider ever has</p>
    <p>code &amp; data necessary to preserve history</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>A Darker Digital Dark Age?</p>
    <p>Many culturally important artifacts are and will increasingly be cloud-based apps &amp; services</p>
    <p>But only the provider can preserve them, and usually have few/no incentives to</p>
    <p>Does the Library of Congress, or anyone, have Google 1.0? Facebook 1.0? WoW 1.0?</p>
    <p>What about the blogs, tweets, or email records of the next Homer/Newton/Marx/Einstein?</p>
    <p>Will cloud artifacts be the next hole in history?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What risks might appear that we're not looking at yet/enough?</p>
    <p>At least five potential risks...</p>
    <p>...and no doubt not the end of the list!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>What are the risks beyond information security?</p>
    <p>What could happen if we don't address them?</p>
    <p>What research should we do to address them?</p>
