    <p>Reality Check</p>
    <p>Think about how academic hiring really works...</p>
    <p>candidates mentally rank schools into top tier, second tier, etc, but dont really know how they would choose between schools within the same tier</p>
    <p>likewise, schools (often explicitly) rank candidates into tiers</p>
    <p>schools interview a small number of candidates</p>
    <p>interviews are informative for both candidates and schools</p>
    <p>at the end, based on the interviews everyone matches up</p>
    <p>Our goal: build a model to explain why this process works as well as it does (and perhaps to identify ways that it can fail).</p>

    <p>Our Model</p>
    <p>We consider a relaxed model in which:</p>
    <p>Agents start out unsure of their own preferences</p>
    <p>They know a (true) partition of agents on the other side of the market into strictly ranked equivalence classes</p>
    <p>In reality agents do have strict preferences</p>
    <p>Initial information can be refined through interviews, which are informative to both parties to the interview</p>
    <p>Goal: find a (true) stable matching that is optimal for a given side of the market, by performing as few interviews as possible.</p>

    <p>Policies</p>
    <p>Definition (Information State)</p>
    <p>The information state Ii of agent i after interviews with `  0 candidates is a list of these ` candidates, ordered according to the underlying true preference profile. The global information state after a sequence of interviews is I = i Ii.</p>
    <p>Definition (Policy)</p>
    <p>A policy is a mapping from a global information state I either to an interview to perform or to a matching. A policy is sound if it is guaranteed to return an employer-optimal matching, regardless of the true preference order.</p>

    <p>Minimizing the Number of Interviews</p>
    <p>Finding a sound policy is easy: perform every interview, then run Gale-Shapley.</p>
    <p>Our goal: perform as few interviews as possible.</p>
    <p>But... as few interviews as possible on which underlying preference ordering? The policy depends on the results of the interviews!</p>
    <p>This is easy if we have a prior distribution over strict orderings (e.g., we believe all orderings are equally likely).</p>
    <p>Definition (Optimal-in-expectation policy)</p>
    <p>A policy f is optimal in expectation if it is sound and it minimizes the expected number of interviews performed, given a prior.</p>
    <p>An optimal-in-expectation policy always exists.</p>

    <p>Impossibility Claim</p>
    <p>Although we can find necessary and impossible matchings tractably, this information isnt as useful as it might seem. It is sometimes still necessary for these pairs to interview when we aim to identify the employer-optimal matching.</p>

    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>We extended classical two-sided matching to a model in which agents are endowed with partial preference information.</p>
    <p>A very weakly dominant policy may not exist.</p>
    <p>Both an optimal-in-expectation policy and a Pareto optimal policy always exist; both can be computed in exponential time.</p>
    <p>We can tractably identify necessary and impossible matches, but nevertheless cant avoid these interviews</p>
    <p>Finding a minimum optimality certificate is NP-hard, and thus so is finding a very weak dominant policy, if one exists.</p>
    <p>When all applicants begin with the same equivalence classes, we can execute a very weakly dominant policy in polytime.</p>
    <p>Key open questions: hardness of executing optimal policies in general; hardness of approximation; characterizing settings where a linear number of interviews suffices; studying decentralized policies.</p>
