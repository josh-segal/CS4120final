    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>I Nash equilibrium: strategy profile that does not allow beneficial unilateral deviation</p>
    <p>I Guaranteed to exist in finite games, but usually not unique I Equilibrium refinements that single out particularly reasonable</p>
    <p>equilibria (see, e.g., van Damme 1983) I Quasi-strict equilibrium (Harsanyi, 1973): every best response</p>
    <p>played with positive probability I Isolated q.s.e. are essential, strongly stable, regular, proper, and</p>
    <p>strictly perfect I Satisfy Cubitt &amp; Sugden (1994) axioms, existence of q.s.e.</p>
    <p>justifies assumption of common knowledge of rationality</p>

    <p>Quasi-Strict Equilibrium</p>
    <p>I Normal-form game  = (N,(Ai )iN,(pi )iN ) I N a set of players I Ai a nonempty set of actions for player i I pi : (</p>
    <p>jN Aj ) R a payoff function for player i</p>
    <p>I Nash equilibrium: strategy profile s  S =</p>
    <p>jN (Aj ) such that for all i  N, a  Ai ,</p>
    <p>pi (s)  p(si,a)</p>
    <p>I Quasi-strict equilibrium: Nash equilibrium s  S such that for all i  N and a,b  Ai with si (a) &gt; 0 and si (b ) = 0,</p>
    <p>pi (si,a) &gt; pi (si,b )</p>

    <p>Some Facts about Quasi-Strict Equilibria</p>
    <p>I Guaranteed to exist in bimatrix games (Norde, 1999) and generic n-player games (Harsanyi, 1973)</p>
    <p>I But not in three-player games, we will see an example later (others by van Damme, 1983; Kojima et al., 1984; Cubitt &amp; Sugden, 1994; Brandt et al., 2007)</p>
    <p>I PPAD-hard in bimatrix games (trivial) I Membership in PPAD not obvious (Brouwer fixed point of a</p>
    <p>mapping that is complicated to construct) I We will see it is likely harder in three-player games</p>

    <p>A Characterization in Matrix Games</p>
    <p>I Theorem: In matrix games, q.s.e. have a unique support, namely the set of all actions played in some Nash equilibrium</p>
    <p>I LP characterization I Start from linear program for ordinary Nash equilibria I Primal and dual are feasible and have the same unique</p>
    <p>solution v (the value of the game) I Construct a feasibility program with the constraints of primal</p>
    <p>and dual, and additional constraints for i  {0,1} and a  Ai :</p>
    <p>si (a) + v &gt;</p>
    <p>bA1i</p>
    <p>s1i (b ) p(a,b )</p>
    <p>I No additional restriction if s1(a) &gt; 0, but action a with s1(a) = 0 yields payoff strictly less than v</p>

    <p>Anonymous and Symmetric Games</p>
    <p>I Anonymous game: payoff depends on own action and number of other players playing each of the different actions (but not their identities)</p>
    <p>I Symmetric game: anonymous plus identical payoff functions for all players</p>
    <p>I Observation: for symmetric matrix games the LP on the previous slide yields a symmetric equilibrium</p>
    <p>I An anonymous game without quasi-strict equilibria:</p>
    <p>(1,1,0) (0,1,1) (0,1,1) (1,0,1) (0,1,1) (1,0,1) (1,0,1) (1,1,0)</p>
