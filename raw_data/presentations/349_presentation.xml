    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>Easy user interface</p>
    <p>Intuitive how preference is blinded</p>
    <p>Code length grows quadratically with n</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Short Code Variant</p>
    <p>Reduce to linear growth</p>
    <p>Shorten initial code</p>
    <p>Additional level of indirection</p>
    <p>Code Length is given by:</p>
    <p>Where n is the number of candidates and p is 1/p probability of guessing location</p>
    <p>probability -&gt; p=2, if n=4</p>
    <p>4+(2-1)(4+1) = 9</p>

    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>Same level of security by using an additional level of indirection</p>
    <p>More work for the voter</p>
    <p>Once a voter has destroyed their left hand side they can be assisted in filling in the Authentication Strip without breaking secrecy</p>

    <p>Further Discussion</p>
    <p>Since the unverified digital signature does not provide the properties we desire, can we remove it and in doing so remove the need to check the WBB?</p>
    <p>There is an additional chain of custody burden for the Authentication Strip</p>
    <p>There is already a chain of custody for the ballot form (in terms of privacy)</p>

    <p>Future Work</p>
    <p>Out of band construction of Authentication Strip</p>
    <p>Removes chain of custody problem</p>
    <p>Possibly increases coercion?</p>

    <p>How can Authentication Strips be used during the Prt  Voter ballot form audit</p>
