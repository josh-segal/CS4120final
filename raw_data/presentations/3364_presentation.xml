    <p>Conclusions and Future Work</p>
    <p>We proposed a new PHY-layer integrity protection scheme called HELP that is resistant to signal cancellation attacks</p>
    <p>Our protocol is aimed at alleviating the device pairing problem for IoT devices that may not have the appropriate interfaces for entering or pre-loading cryptographic primitives.</p>
    <p>We showed that the DH key agreement protocol using HELP can resist MitM attacks without requiring an authenticated channel between device and the hub.</p>
    <p>Future Work: Investigate a MitM-resistant in-band pairing technique that does not rely on ON-OFF keying so that it is compatible with COTS devices</p>
