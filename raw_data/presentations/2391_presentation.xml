    <p>Future Work  Attempt to estimate how much traffic is generated by</p>
    <p>Facebook Spam  Collaboration to utilize more/different spam feeds  Incorporate better/more automation  Contact ad networks to determine if they close down or</p>
    <p>provide information on their affiliates that engage in abusing advertising</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusions  Presented an empirical study of Facebook spam  Revealing 73% of the working spam URLs in our Facebook</p>
    <p>spam were monetized by survey scams sponsored by Ad Networks</p>
    <p>Based on our manual analysis of 129 unique spam URLs over 50% were traced to: Amung.us, CPAlead, ClickBanner, and LifeStreet Media</p>
    <p>Carbon Dating Results: Average age of URLs was 9 months  Indicates ad networks are not proactively detecting/blocking affiliates</p>
    <p>that engage in abusive advertisements</p>
    <p>Preliminary Results: Potential point to demonetize the spam ecosystem by intervening at these ad networks that sponsor spam</p>
