    <p>Log-Structured File Systems and Flash Memory</p>
    <p>pages are the unit of read/write operations</p>
    <p>erase blocks are the unit of erasures</p>
    <p>a page must be erased before it can be written</p>
    <p>erasures are costly: power, wear, time</p>

    <p>deletion only occurs when block storing data is re-allocated</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals of our Solution</p>
    <p>provide guaranteed secure deletion of data</p>
    <p>simple to use/install for users of mobile phones efficient in terms of erasures/block allocations</p>
    <p>effects lifetime of device, battery consumption, CPU time</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>How to Target our Solution</p>
    <p>system-level change is more powerful we can change the operating system to ensure deletion of sensitive data requires:</p>
    <p>non-standard operating system non-trivial installation proceedure voiding warranty of device</p>
    <p>some related work</p>
    <p>user-level change more usable ideal is a simple app one can install to securely delete data does not rely on manufacturer to provide it much more limited access model</p>
    <p>only create / delete local files</p>
    <p>no effective related work</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Our three user-level solutions: purging, ballooning, and a hybrid.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Purging</p>
    <p>fills the storage medium to capacity no available space remains</p>
    <p>requires no disk quota limitations in user-space no deleted data remains when the device claims to be full</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Purging</p>
    <p>X-axis: space of storage medium</p>
    <p>Y-axis: time</p>
    <p>black square: writing to a block at a time</p>
    <p>distance between two black squares: bound on deletion latency</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Purging</p>
    <p>Storage medium size Purging cost</p>
    <p>advantages:</p>
    <p>guarantees deletion deletion latencys upper bound is purging interval</p>
    <p>disadvantage:</p>
    <p>requires erasing nearly every erase block</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Ballooning</p>
    <p>continually occupy empty space on the storage medium</p>
    <p>create/delete junk files to keep empty space at a threshold</p>
    <p>user observes no difference, except smaller available free space</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Ballooning</p>
    <p>X-axis: space of storage medium</p>
    <p>Y-axis: time</p>
    <p>black square: writing to a block at a time</p>
    <p>distance between two black squares: bound on deletion latency</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Ballooning</p>
    <p>Size Fill ratio* Blk allocs/hr Deletion Latency **</p>
    <p>* average percent of live data per erase block</p>
    <p>** 95th percentile measurement (100th undefined)</p>
    <p>advantages:</p>
    <p>trade-off between block allocation rate and deletion latency</p>
    <p>disadvantages:</p>
    <p>deletion is not guaranteed</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Hybrid Solution</p>
    <p>combine ballooning at all times with occasional purging purging can be triggered automatically or manually</p>
    <p>periodic purging guarantees deletion purging is faster since ballooning occupies large empty space</p>
    <p>well-suited to reduce the cost of purging for large media</p>
    <p>Storage medium size Fill ratio* Purge cost</p>
    <p>* average percent of live data per erase block</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>Size Fill ratio* Blk allocs/hr Deletion Latency ** Purge Cost</p>
    <p>* average percent of live data per erase block</p>
    <p>** 95th percentile measurement (100th undefined)</p>
    <p>we have implemented this as a user-space application</p>
    <p>we also analyzed device wear and battery consumption</p>
