    <p>Baseline Method -- Meeting Frequency</p>
    <p>the more frequently you co-locate with another person,</p>

    <p>Personal Background is important</p>
    <p>Shanghai has a lower probability to be visited. Co-location in Shanghai is less likely, but it happens. Co-location event in Shanghai should carry higher weight.</p>

    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>We propose a unified framework to measure the strength of relationship based on two users mobility.</p>
    <p>Our model is simple and deterministic, which considers:</p>
    <p>Personal probability visiting a location</p>
    <p>Location popularity from general public</p>
    <p>Temporal correlation among co-locations</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Future work</p>
    <p>Extend this work from identifying pairwise relationships to discovering common interest groups.</p>
    <p>Further combine the context at each location, such as the activity at that location.</p>

    <p>Dataset Properties</p>
    <p>The Gowalla users tend to check-in at featured spots, and recommend places and trips for others.</p>
    <p>The Brightkite users tend to check-in with acquaintance to maintain personal social circle.</p>
    <p>As a result, check-ins in Gowalla are mostly made on popular places.</p>
