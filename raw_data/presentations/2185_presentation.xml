    <p>Relations based on Rhetoric Structure Theory</p>
    <p>RST characterizes structure of text in terms of relations that hold between parts of text</p>
    <p>RST describes relations between clauses in text which might not be syntactically linked</p>
    <p>RST helps to discover text patterns such as nucleus/satellite structure with relation such as evidence, justify, antithesis, concession and so on.</p>
