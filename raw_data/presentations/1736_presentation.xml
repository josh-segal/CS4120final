  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Providing secure access to right information at the right time, to the right entities is important</p>
    <p>Access control and authorization needs to be context-dependent, and scalable</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Hypothetical scenario 1:  A Train derails inside the City of Champaign  First Responders meet at the Emergency</p>
    <p>Operations Center (EOC)  For swift decisions, information needed from</p>
    <p>various sources  Video cameras at nearby locations  Three gas sensors used by the Hazmat team  Windspeed, direction sensors  Waterflow sensors from USGS</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Hypothetical scenario 1:  The info sources belong to different</p>
    <p>organizations  Security domains are different  Some resources will not be shared in normal</p>
    <p>situations  Cameras may not be shared, to protect privacy</p>
    <p>Not feasible or manageable to create logins at every organization</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Hypothetical scenario 2:  The information from all power stations in the mid</p>
    <p>west are collected by Midwest ISO. For marketrelated reasons, all the details are not normally shared with every client</p>
    <p>Suppose, an overload trips a generator in Champaign, IL. This, and other info from MISO can be used by other power stations to balance their loads</p>
    <p>Lack of information caused the 2003 powergrid failure  But the info is also sensitive, so should only be shared</p>
    <p>during emergencies</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Hypothetical scenario 2:  Here the information source is single, but there</p>
    <p>are multiple clients  Not all information are shared with every client  Not all clients get the same view</p>
    <p>Access to information is situation/context dependent</p>
    <p>It is not feasible to create logins for every plant operator</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Solution?</p>
    <p>To utilize Trust Negotiation in creating a flexible information sharing framework</p>
    <p>Use access control policies, to determine level of access to information</p>
    <p>Use a modular architecture for separating the applications from the underlying security infrastructure</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Contribution</p>
    <p>A generalized modular framework for Policy-based Trust-aware secure information sharing (Synergy)</p>
    <p>Utilization of heterogeneous components in building a situational awareness system (VisiRescue), running on top of Synergy</p>

    <p>Synergy  Goals</p>
    <p>To build a information sharing framework that is,  Secure  Modular  Extensible</p>
    <p>Decouple security and authorization mechanisms from information sources and consumers to allow diverse systems to be integrated easily</p>
    <p>Use Trust Negotiation for attribute-based authorization</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Trust negotiation overview</p>
    <p>An iterative way of establishing trust between strangers</p>
    <p>Uses attributes, certified by unforgeable digital credentials for authorization</p>
    <p>Automated exchange based on policies allow flexibility and scalability</p>
    <p>Example implementations:  Trustbuilder (UIUC and BYU)  Trust-X (Purdue, Milan)</p>

    <p>Synergy components  Information Producer</p>
    <p>The source of information, for example, a windspeed sensor  Information Consumer</p>
    <p>The consumer of information, for example, a GIS display  Synergy Server</p>
    <p>Provides access to resources based on access policies  Synergy Client</p>
    <p>Retrieves information and converts it for use by consumer  Trust Agent</p>
    <p>Provides access through Trust Negotiation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Model</p>
    <p>Synergy Servers provide negotiated access to resources</p>
    <p>Synergy clients communicates with server, provides resources to local application</p>
    <p>Trust Agents negotiate access to information on behalf of Synergy clients and servers</p>
    <p>Information Consumers interpret and use the information</p>
    <p>Information Sources set policies for access to information</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Protocol (informal description)  Client to Server:</p>
    <p>Request resource list  Server to Client:</p>
    <p>Either the list, or a request for negotiation  Client:</p>
    <p>Invoke its Trust Agent, negotiate with servers designated Trust Agent, obtain token, resend list request</p>
    <p>Client to Server:  Request individual resources</p>
    <p>Server to Client:  Either the value of the resource, or a request to negotiate further</p>
    <p>Client:  Invoke Trust Agent, negotiate, get token, resend request with token</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <p>Decouple security and authorization from information producers and consumers  This allows integrating any application on top of</p>
    <p>Synergy</p>
    <p>TN allows attribute based authorization between the information producer and consumers domain,  More scalable and flexible than traditional</p>
    <p>identity based schemes</p>
