    <p>Jail, Hero or Drug Lord? Turning a Cyber Security Course Into an 11 Week Choose</p>
    <p>Your Own Adventure Story</p>

    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Story/narrative is an important aspect of gamification.</p>
    <p>In making cyber security education challenges this is often overlooked.</p>
    <p>Types of Games</p>
    <p>Introduction Technical engine Story development Evaluation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Examples of narrative within security training</p>
    <p>Within competitions, the use of narrative is common</p>
    <p>- PicoCTF used a story about helping a broken robot get home</p>
    <p>- HackFu is set in a theatrical environment (with actors playing roles within the story!)</p>
    <p>Intro to CS course as a campus treasure-hunt, with CTF-style challenges, puzzlebased learning, and alternate reality games (1st year undergrad)</p>
    <p>Security and cryptography courses following Divergent storyline (school level)</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Our Goal</p>
    <p>Provide a framework to put exercises into the context of a story.</p>
    <p>The story should tie the exercises together, for a 11 weeks cyber security course.</p>
    <p>Students should have control over the story.</p>
    <p>End-goal: Improve student engagement &amp; attainment within the course.</p>
    <p>Introduction Technical engine Story development Evaluation</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Contribution</p>
    <p>We have developed a choose-your-own-adventure story engine to add a narrative to educational CTF challenges.</p>
    <p>We have written a story for this based on investigating a black market site (The Cotton Highway), in a corrupt company.</p>
    <p>We have used this with a 2nd year cyber security class and collected data about its affect.</p>

    <p>We're having issues trying to decrypt some files - maybe you could take a look at them? We've put them in your home directory so you can get started on them.</p>
    <p>Once you've managed to get in, each should have a cryptographic token in them. Please reply with as many of those tokens you can find. Under no circumstances, should you relay this onto anyone else. N.</p>
    <p>From: monkey.see482@imeverywhere.sensiblefurniture.com Subject: Welcome to the doghouse. Want to see what actually goes on?</p>
    <p>Hey!</p>
    <p>I told those guys in IT they need to give you stronger encryption keys for email. Guess old moneybags decided it's too expensive to actually care. What do you care, anyway? You're the new cybergeek I see - what a generic term nowadays which has absolutely no context.</p>
    <p>Who am I? You'll find out soon enough, but you need to prove yourself to me first. Why am I emailing you? Well, congratulations smarto - you bagged last place in the prize list. The guy who sat in your seat was involved in something big, but he went missing. So... what happens if one of your best goes 'away'? You replace them with someone better, or at least that's probably what HR said to you to sell the job.</p>
    <p>This is where you come in. The email you just got from Adler? There's more context than just a simple decryption task to get you started. [...]</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Student comments Comments on story or plot - I did like the complicated underground manoeuvres of the Sensible Furniture crowd. The Charles Garcia reveal and discovering the message that led to his demise was also a big moment in the tale. - Was genuinely upset when Chimp died. RIP.</p>
    <p>Were you happy with the ending? - No. Because I went to jail. Also I can see now that there was a way to win as the bad guy. - I liked the opportunity to choose a path, but also be able to change at certain points. Felt involved with the characters and had a fitting ending. - I didn't lose (end up in jail), the taste of victory is sweet.</p>
    <p>Introduction Technical engine Story development Evaluation</p>
    <p>Why do you think that concept of adding the story is a good idea? - Engages students to pay attention to the exercises, gives them a little real-life context (which often aids understanding) and instils confidence in students that the course is being very well-managed. - It's a lot more engaging and it puts you in a hackers position (something we've all wanted to do) without the real life consequences.</p>
    <p>Would other courses benefit from a story mechanic? - I could see something like this working for robot programming where you would have to program a virtual robot in some sort of story. - Modules like Graphics can have story elements. So for example, a detective case: to get the final clue to solve the murder/treasure, one needs to create this graphical image which contains some clue.</p>

    <p>Future work</p>

    <p>Working with other Universities which are interested in adopting and expanding the framework</p>
    <p>Adding story engine into SecGen framework (Cliffe Schreuders, Leeds Beckett University).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Developed a choose-your-own-adventure story engine which can be added to exercises, in order to tie them together in a real-life scenario</p>
    <p>Wrote a story for our ICS module, based on investigating a black market site</p>
    <p>Showed that adding a story increased student engagement with the course material</p>
    <p>Showed that students who followed the story did in fact score higher marks in ICS</p>
