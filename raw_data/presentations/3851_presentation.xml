    <p>The Good of CLI</p>

    <p>The Bad of CLI</p>

    <p>The Good of GUI</p>
    <p>it allows me to have a better understanding of a firewalls configuration while having that information displayed in a more organized manner when compared to a CLI.</p>
    <p>because of my responsibilities as a general sysadmin, management of the firewall takes up only a small part of my time, and having using the GUI for management means that I do not have to remember CLI commands.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>The Bad of GUI</p>
    <p>missing a lot of features/settings, so that you have to use CLI to make changes</p>
    <p>documenting a GUI is mostly useless and defeats most of the purpose of a GUI</p>

    <p>a shift towards GUI</p>
    <p>Interfaces getting better?</p>
