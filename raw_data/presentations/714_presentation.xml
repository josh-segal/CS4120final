    <p>Our Solution (2)</p>
    <p>Sacrificing the Plum Tree for the Peach Tree</p>
    <p>Each vehicle reveals one socialspot, i.e., shopping mall, that he often visits. The socialspot is non-sensitive, since many vehicles also visit. The socialspot serves as as a stationary relay node (deployed with RSU), to help packet forwarding, at the same time, protect other sensitive location privacy.</p>

    <p>Thank you!</p>
    <p>In our future work, we are ready to evaluate the performance with the real-world tracing. In our future work, we are ready to evaluate the performance with the real-world tracing.</p>
