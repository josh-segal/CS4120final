  <div class="page">
    <p>Zeus's Background</p>
    <p>Greek academia under tight-schedule reforms  Universities must elect their new governing councils  Bill mandates electronic voting option, GRNET shall support  Reforms controversial in some circles  Traditional elections being physically shut down by protesters</p>
    <p>Numerous incidents in Zeus elections too</p>
    <p>All Zeus elections successful with good turnout  Used by many institutions in the country, including the</p>
    <p>biggest ones</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Helios Introduction</p>
    <p>Verifiable, all-digital voting  Two versions, originally used mixnets, then switched to</p>
    <p>homomorphic tallying  Software available only for homomorphic (Helios3)</p>
    <p>Voters may repeatedly revise their vote to counter coercion  Voters invited by e-mail  optionally cast audit ballots until satisfied that browser is not compromised</p>
    <p>then login and cast authentic vote</p>
    <p>Encryption key split across trustees and server  Nobody ever holds the entire key</p>

    <p>Structured Proof Document</p>
    <p>Parallel Sako-Killian Mixnet</p>
    <p>Modified Audit</p>
    <p>Pre-authenticated invitation link</p>
    <p>Signed vote submission receiptno BB</p>
    <p>Parallel decryption in-browser &amp; shell</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Modifications: Single Transferable Vote (STV)</p>
    <p>Single Transferable Vote required  Special requirement: ties broken by traditional (manual) lot by the electoral</p>
    <p>committee, not electronically</p>
    <p>A pre-existing counting system was to be used</p>
    <p>Could not do it with Helios3  We moved away from homomorphic tallying</p>
    <p>Implemented a Sako-Killian mixnet  Outputs whole ballots as they were encrypted</p>
    <p>Modified ballot structure and encryption proof  Encoded ranked candidate list as an integer</p>
    <p>Discrete log knowledge proof (Schnorr) for encryption validation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Modifications due to Usability Constraints</p>
    <p>Original plan for (mobile phone) two-factor authentication  logistically impossible in the timeframe, no usable registry</p>
    <p>Forced choice between audit and normal vote deemed too confusing/dangerous  we replaced it with an audit code-based, more obscure auditing</p>
    <p>procedure, based on our two-factor authentication primitives</p>
    <p>Login page between clicking invitation link and voting booth deemed too cumbersome and confusing  voters might have tried their webmail or other credentials</p>
    <p>credentials were embedded in the invitation link</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Further Concerns Addressed</p>
    <p>Access to election data and proofs at the discretion of trustees  no anonymous access for coercers</p>
    <p>signed vote submission receipts to compensate for lack of public bulletin board</p>
    <p>Voters can be disqualified during voting and their votes cancelled  error, misbehavior, or other valid reason</p>
    <p>this is logged in the proofs document</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Zeus Audit Votes</p>
    <p>Helios' repeated pretend audit votes helps prove that the local browser does not cheat  Audit votes are revealed as such after uploading to server, so browser can no</p>
    <p>longer interfere</p>
    <p>Zeus server and voter share secret codes  The browser does not have them</p>
    <p>Voter optionally attaches a code to a submission</p>
    <p>If the code is among the secret shared it's a real vote</p>
    <p>if not, it's an audit vote and the browser is asked to reveal the encryption, the user is asked to confirm publishing the audit vote</p>
    <p>If code attachement is made mandatory, it becomes a second authentication factor</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Ranked List to ElGamal Group Element Encoding</p>
    <p>Enumerate all possible candidate selections  give smaller ordinals to ballots with fewer candidates</p>
    <p>this saves a lot of plaintext bit-space if only a few selections are allowed</p>
    <p>0 is blank vote  greater than the total selections is a spoilt vote  we embed more election types within this encoding  e.g. multiple party elections</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Party List Elections</p>
    <p>Zeus ballot is a ranked list of candidates  Encode party lists as a candidate list with standard</p>
    <p>format  include parameters for validation at counting:</p>
    <p>min/max selections per party, whether selections from multiple parties are allowed, etc.</p>
    <p>Each election type has its specialized creation form and booth</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Vote Submission Receipt</p>
    <p>Signed by the server  Contains election key, candidate list, ciphertext,</p>
    <p>superseded vote (if any)  to be used in claims to the trustees, forensics</p>
    <p>Does not identify voter, is publishable  No name, IP, time, session, etc.</p>
    <p>Compensates for lack of a safe BB</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Running Elections</p>
    <p>Trustees ultimately responsible for elections  handled communication with voters</p>
    <p>Helpdesk supports trustees and voters with usability  helpdesk member on site in many elections</p>
    <p>Engineering team supports incident handling  Help with investigation, reports, public statements</p>
    <p>Trustees negotiated details in many cases  asked for specialized reports, requested features, etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Election Incidents Handled</p>
    <p>DoS</p>
    <p>Fake Invitations</p>
    <p>Early Voting, DoS</p>
    <p>Occupation, Mail Shutdown</p>
    <p>Occupation, Mail Shutdown</p>
    <p>Social Engineering ID Theft Attempt</p>
    <p>Post credentials on Facebook</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Attacks against Elections</p>
    <p>Network DoS attempts (2 x slowloris)  Voter posts his voting link on Facebook  he was excluded during voting</p>
    <p>Occupation of infrastructure premises  shut network or e-mail servers down  circumvented by setting up alternate servers, extending voting for days until</p>
    <p>resolution</p>
    <p>Social engineering to change voter's registered e-mail  detected by us, corrected before election day</p>
    <p>Fake voting e-mails from compromised university machines  frustrated voters but ultimately overcome with new servers</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Issues With Voters</p>
    <p>Replies to the e-mail with secret credentials  also, vacation auto-replies with body</p>
    <p>Failing to open the submission receipt  while plaintext, deliberately not named *.txt</p>
    <p>Webmail applications distorting the voting link  e.g. using some exit gateway</p>
    <p>Browser compatibility  hard decision but we dropped IE support</p>
    <p>not a big problem after all</p>
    <p>Good helpdesk is essential</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Issues with Trustees</p>
    <p>USB device with election key fails  fortunately our instructions were to have 2 such devices</p>
    <p>Trustees often trust each other too much  e.g. exchange their keys for backup</p>
    <p>Trustees often needed a tech-savvy operator for handling the computer interactions at their command  usually someone trusted from IT support</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Answering to Skeptics</p>
    <p>Complaint that remote voting destroys the critical social character of election day</p>
    <p>There was detailed documentation of how it works, in layman terms</p>
    <p>Numerous (valid and invalid) objections but obviously politically motivated</p>
    <p>There were no objections on the real problem  complete trust in the election service provider</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Observations about Trust</p>
    <p>Easier to trust if it feels like traditional elections  An election was cancelled and rescheduled because voting started earlier than</p>
    <p>announced</p>
    <p>Some were not comfortable with elections running for more than a day, or even at night hours</p>
    <p>Trappings of officialdom and procedure are reassuring  Most trustee committees were eager to follow due procedure and safeguard</p>
    <p>elections  Some created detailed documentation for the voters</p>
    <p>Some took extensive counter measures to ensure elections could not be stopped</p>
    <p>Flexibility to answer specialized report &amp; feature requests important  Trustee insights invaluable to predict behaviors and sentiments</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Risks not addressed during elections</p>
    <p>Almost nobody audited their booth in an official election  indeed, we made auditing obscure on purpose</p>
    <p>No committee chose to make additional mix  even though a lot of effort went into organisation and</p>
    <p>incident response</p>
    <p>not even the experts bothered because they trusted us and did not want the overhead</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Standardization and Independent Verification are Really Needed</p>
    <p>The most trustees can do is safeguard a proper procedure  Only an expert can really evaluate safety and security</p>
    <p>Even if the election service provider is an expert there must be someone else checking on them  at the least, mixing votes and verifying results</p>
    <p>The independent verifier's job is easy  After setting up a server there is no more overhead with any</p>
    <p>administrative or other issue while running elections</p>
    <p>We are very interested in such independent verifier collaborations  maybe work on procedure standardization too</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Future Plans for Zeus</p>
    <p>There's more elections scheduled  Clean-up, start proper development project  Implement faster mixing  Work on standalone mixing &amp; verification service</p>
    <p>and associated standardization</p>
    <p>Optimize usage, browser support  Consider mobile devices as better trusted clients</p>
