    <p>Set Cover Problem</p>
    <p>Definition  Given a set of elements U = {1, 2, , m } (called the universe) and a</p>
    <p>family S of n sets whose union equals the universe, the set cover problem is to identify the smallest subset of S the union of which contains all elements in the universe.</p>
    <p>Greedy Algorithm  Rule to select sets</p>
    <p>At each stage, choose the set that contains the largest number of uncovered elements.</p>
    <p>Upper bound  O(log s), where s is the size of the largest set from S</p>
