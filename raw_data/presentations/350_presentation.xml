    <p>Emulab  Public network testbed</p>
    <p>Create complex experiments quickly</p>
    <p>500+ nodes at Utah Emulab</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Emulab Nodes</p>
    <p>Physical nodes  Users have root  Space/time shared</p>
    <p>Artifacts from previous experiment may persist on node</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Why Reset State?</p>
    <p>Experiment fidelity depends on starting fresh</p>
    <p>Unacceptable for security sensitive experiments</p>
    <p>At the very least, artifacts from previous experiments are irritating</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Emulabs Current Method  Control server forces reboot and directs</p>
    <p>node re-imaging over network</p>
    <p>Network is shared with other nodes</p>
    <p>State reset is not guaranteed and is not tamper-proof</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals</p>
    <p>Must reset node state during other active experiments and regardless of what state the node is left in</p>
    <p>Must be flexible for many boot paths</p>
    <p>Must scale to size of testbed</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Solution: Trusted Disk Loading System (TDLS)</p>
    <p>If the experiment is created successfully, node state is reset</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Contributions</p>
    <p>Cryptographically verifiable method of resetting physical node state</p>
    <p>Flexible and secure reloading software scalable to size of testbed</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Establish trust</p>
    <p>Verify every stage of node reloading with control server</p>
    <p>The Trusted Platform Module is the perfect tool for such objectives</p>

    <p>Trusted Platform Module (TPM)</p>
    <p>Secure key storage  Measurement  Remote attestation (quotes)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Secure Key Storage  Keys are always encrypted before they</p>
    <p>leave the TPM</p>
    <p>Keys are only useable on the same TPM with which they were created</p>
    <p>Control server can identify nodes by the public portion of these keys</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Measurement  Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) o TPMs generally have 24 PCRs o Holds a hash o PCRs can only be modified through extension o Extending:</p>
    <p>PCR = hash(previous value of PCR + a new hash)</p>
    <p>Measuring is when we hash a region of memory and extend a certain PCR with the resulting hash</p>

    <p>Secure Boot Chain with TPM</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Remote Attestation (Quotes)</p>
    <p>TPM packages up the desired PCRs and signs them</p>
    <p>Tamper-proof as it is signed by the TPM</p>
    <p>Very easy to differentiate between a genuine quote and arbitrary data signed by TPM</p>

    <p>Starting the chain: Booting to PXE</p>
    <p>PXE ROMs arent TPM aware</p>
    <p>PXE ROMs won't check-in with the control server</p>
    <p>Boot to USB dongle with gPXE</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Stage 1: gPXE</p>
    <p>Measured by BIOS  Embedded certificate authority for server authentication  Sends a quote to control server 22</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Checking Quotes  Different stages are measured into different PCRs</p>
    <p>Quotes contain a nonce from the server to guarantee freshness</p>
    <p>The TPM signature over the quotes are verified</p>
    <p>Server compares every PCR in the quote with known values in the database</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Incorrect Quotes</p>
    <p>An incorrect PCR means something was modified</p>
    <p>Failure to send a quote before a timeout is treated as a verification failure</p>
    <p>Control server cuts power to the node and quarantines it</p>

    <p>Stage 2: GRUB</p>

    <p>Sensitive Resources</p>
    <p>Control server closes monitors a nodes progress via quotes</p>
    <p>A node can only receive sensitive resources (decryption keys) in a particular state</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Stage 3: Imaging MFS</p>

    <p>Stage 4: Signoff</p>
    <p>Disk is imaged  Extends known value into designated reboot PCR  Marks the end of the trusted chain 28</p>

    <p>Attacks That Will Fail  Any boot stage corruption  BIOS code or configuration modifications  Injecting new stages</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Summary  Node state must be fully reset in a secure way</p>
    <p>o Some testbed properties make this very difficult</p>
    <p>Using the Trusted Platform Module o Establish trust between the node and server o Verify every stage of bootchain</p>
    <p>Trusted Disk Loading System o Tracks node progress with quotes o Guarantees node state is reset</p>
    <p>If any check fails, the experiment creation will fail</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Future Work  Enable experimenters to verify node state</p>
    <p>Refine the violation model</p>
    <p>Integrate with Emulab UI</p>
    <p>Deploy on 160 TPM-enabled nodes at Utah</p>
