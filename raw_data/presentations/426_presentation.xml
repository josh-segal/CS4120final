    <p>SIP: Background</p>
    <p>Textual protocol (modeled after http, ftp, etc.)</p>
    <p>Request-response pattern.</p>
    <p>6 requests: INVITE, BYE, ACK, OPTIONS, REGISTER, CANCEL</p>
    <p>6 classes of responses: 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, and 6xx.</p>
    <p>Many actors: UAC, UAS, Registrar, Redirect server, B2BUAs.</p>

    <p>Need for a CLF</p>
    <p>Too many entities involved.</p>
    <p>Need some way to keep track of what is going on in real-time or post processed.</p>
    <p>Model: HTTP CLF!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>HTTP CLF</p>
    <p>IP address of client Making the request</p>
    <p>Remote logname of user as determined by rfc931</p>
    <p>Name by which user has authenticated himself.</p>
    <p>Date/time access was made.</p>
    <p>Request line</p>
    <p>Status code (response returned by server)</p>
    <p>Length of document transferred.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Benefits of HTTP CLF</p>
    <p>HTTP Common Log File format is used widely:  ... obviously, log access to resources.  Perform trend analysis.  Perform anomaly detection  Encourage third party tool developers.</p>
    <p>There isn't an analogous CLF format for SIP.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Benefits of a SIP CLF</p>
    <p>Benefits of a SIP CLF:</p>
    <p>Establishes a common reference for interpreting SIP transaction state across vendor/open-source implementations.</p>
    <p>Train anomaly detection systems to trigger alarms.</p>
    <p>Allow independent tool providers to provide innovative tools for trend analysis and traffic reports.</p>
    <p>Common diagnostic trail from testing of SIP equipment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Use cases</p>
    <p>Trend analysis (I want to find out which geographical area are the most calls coming from at 2:00 AM).</p>
    <p>Troubleshooting (How long did it take to generate a final response to an INVITE?)</p>
    <p>Message correlation across transactions (Find all messages corresponding to Call-ID X, including all forked branches)</p>
    <p>Transaction correlation across dialogs (Find all messages for dialog created by Call-ID X and tags A and B)</p>
    <p>Establish concise and standardized diagnostic trail of a SIP session locally and globally</p>
    <p>Establish concise and standardized format for training automata (anomaly detection)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges in defining a SIP CLF</p>
    <p>SIP is not a linear request-reply protocol</p>
    <p>HTTP is linear: pipelining okay, one request = one response.</p>
    <p>Complexity inherent in the protocol:</p>
    <p>Serial and parallel forking elicit multiple responses.</p>
    <p>Delays between getting a request and sending a response (origin server in HTTP is quick; UAS not quite so. Impact on proxies.)</p>
    <p>Multiple transactions grouped in a dialog; dialog persists for a long time, transactions short-lived (e.g., BYE comes much later, but relation between INV and BYE should be preserved in a log file.)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges in defining a SIP CLF</p>
    <p>ACK requests need careful considerations:  Only tied to an INVITE.  No responses for ACKs.  For non-2xx, ACKs hop-by-hop (part of INV transaction.)  For 2xx, ACK end-to-end.</p>
    <p>CANCEL requests need careful considerations:  Only tied to an INVITE.  Requires exactly one response.  Is propagated hop-by-hop.</p>
    <p>INV can pend, resulting in a 1xx response (200ms rule.) This 1xx response needs to be captured to train automata.</p>
    <p>SIP has a richer set of actors: UAS, UAC, B2BUA, proxy, registrar, redirect server, ...</p>

    <p>Need for CLF in literature</p>
    <p>[Rieck et al., 2008] extracts a feature set into a high-dimension vector space to express normality and deviation geometrically.</p>
    <p>[Abdelnur et al. 2007] train a FSM on raw SIP messages.</p>
    <p>Problems:</p>
    <p>SIP parsing is a horribly complex (grammar is not LL(1) so tools like yacc(1) don't quite work).</p>
    <p>SIP parsing is an expensive operation.</p>
    <p>The SIP messages could be encrypted on the wire.</p>

    <p>What SIP CLF is and is not ...</p>
    <p>SIP CLF is NOT</p>
    <p>a replacement for a CDR (Call Detail Record).</p>
    <p>a billing tool.</p>
    <p>a QoS measurement tool.</p>
    <p>SIP CLF IS:</p>
    <p>a standardized format that can be used by all SIP entities.</p>
    <p>an easily digestible log of past and current transactions.</p>
    <p>a format that allows quick parsing to discover relation-ships between transactions</p>
    <p>$ grep yuhyt6 sip-clf.txt</p>
    <p>gets all transactions with this label.</p>
