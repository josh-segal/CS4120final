    <p>But MRAI has jitter!</p>
    <p>The BGP-4 RFC requires that routers add 25% jitter to MRAIs to avoid weird resonance behaviors. The above bounds rely on tight timings between different MRAIs, but only in one direction:</p>
    <p>If jitter broadens the gap between two MRAIs, all the above bounds work</p>
    <p>E.g., jitterless exponential bounds + jitter = exponential expectation bounds but with the exponent halved</p>

    <p>Open problems</p>
    <p>We cant measure others preferences. Look at real occurence of risky graph structures? MRAI is usually per-session, not per-prefix: what if multiple destinations are in flux? Find simple, practical heuristics extensions of the MRAI mechanism that resolve this:</p>
    <p>Conjecture: there exists an MRAI-like scheme that slows down announcements about distant destinations, and avoids all the convergence problems above.</p>

    <p>The sky isnt falling, but we will benefit from a better-understood deployment of such changes.</p>
    <p>Coordinated timing changes are much better  encourage uniformity (unless we have solid evidence for mitigating circumstances</p>
    <p>Use an understanding of worst-case patterns to look for them in measurement data to evaluate the risks.</p>
