    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 2</p>
    <p>How I became the Wireless Manager for SCaLE</p>
    <p>March 2008, Me to SCaLE networking folks:</p>
    <p>Wireless at ScaLE didn't work, what did you do? &lt;cringe&gt; That's complely wrong, I can help.</p>
    <p>Jan 2010, SCaLE networking folks to me:</p>
    <p>You said you know something about wifi, our vendor just backed out and we will have around 1200 people arriving in a month, can you help us?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 3</p>
    <p>Why does wireless always suck?  Wifi works great when setup and tested. Then</p>
    <p>lots of people try to use it, then it doesn't degrade gracefully, it just collapses.</p>
    <p>Is this a fundamental limitation of Wifi?  Yes and No. It's primarily a Radio side issue</p>
    <p>Yes, there is limited radio airtime and when you run out collapse happens</p>
    <p>No, there are many things you can do to delay the collapse</p>
    <p>Do 'Enterprise Class' AP's solve the problem?  No, many of them make it worse</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 4</p>
    <p>Defining the problem</p>
    <p>Conferences have lots of people in small areas</p>
    <p>Tech Conferences have lots of devices  Scale 10x 1965 people 1935 devices</p>
    <p>875 connected at once</p>
    <p>Radios only allow one thing to talk on a given channel at any point in time</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 5</p>
    <p>Radio Problems</p>
    <p>Not enough Channels (especially on 2.4GHz)  Should not use the same channel in nearby</p>
    <p>locations. Ideally at least 3x service range between re-use</p>
    <p>Hidden Transmitters  A small amount of interference will trash the</p>
    <p>entire packet</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 6</p>
    <p>Protocol Problems</p>
    <p>Wifi Speed fallback  Housekeeping traffic</p>
    <p>Just staying connected to an AP generates traffic</p>
    <p>When you get too many devices connected to one AP you have no airtime left to actually pass user data</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 7</p>
    <p>Digital Network Issue</p>
    <p>Bufferbloat  In an attempt to prevent packet loss (and with</p>
    <p>cheap memory) network buffers have become gigantic</p>
    <p>If there is congestion, the packets can sit in the buffers long enough that the sender retransmits them before they arrive, so data gets sent multiple times, adding to the congestion</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 8</p>
    <p>How the collapse happens</p>
    <p>The combination of  Retries</p>
    <p>Hidden Transmitters</p>
    <p>Fallback to slow speeds</p>
    <p>Wasted packets due to bufferbloat</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 9</p>
    <p>Power Levels and Antennas</p>
    <p>Turning up power seldom helps  In fact it usually hurts  Better antennas are almost always better than</p>
    <p>amplifiers</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 10</p>
    <p>A quick note on Enterprise APs</p>
    <p>Many radios in one spot  Some with directional antennas</p>
    <p>Hidden transmitter problem caused by antenna patterns</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 11</p>
    <p>This is bad, now what  So now that we've seen how the networks</p>
    <p>collapse, what can be done to make things better?</p>
    <p>First off, find out what you are up against  Site survey</p>
    <p>MySpy spectrum analyzer  Kismet  Wifi analyzer  Bring an AP  Find the network jacks</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 12</p>
    <p>Fixes</p>
    <p>Encourage 5GHz</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 13</p>
    <p>Fixes</p>
    <p>Lots of access points  Turn down power on 2.4Ghz</p>
    <p>How far down? Waaaay down  Scale 10x had the AP's set to 4mw</p>
    <p>Remember that it doesn't help to use more power than the devices you are talking to.</p>
    <p>Take advantage of things that block the signal  Walls, Bodies, etc. Don't create more hidden</p>
    <p>transmitters</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 14</p>
    <p>Fixes</p>
    <p>Use advanced antennas carefully  To direct the signal away from areas more than</p>
    <p>towards them</p>
    <p>To reach into areas where you don't have wires</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 15</p>
    <p>Digital Issues</p>
    <p>SSIDs  One allows roaming</p>
    <p>Many allow users to specify best AP</p>
    <p>Use one per band</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High Density Wireless LISA 2012 16</p>
    <p>Config Items  Enable Wireless Isolation  Beacon Interval</p>
    <p>Advertise the SSID less frequently, delays connections but saves airtime</p>
    <p>Prime value to reduce sync issues</p>
    <p>Disable slow speeds  Kernel buffers/FQ_Codel queuing  Disable conntrak (netfilter)  Short inactivity timers</p>
