    <p>Challenges in Wireless System Design</p>
    <p>Energy saving is not easy  Limited battery capacity in wireless devices  High power consumption in wireless communication</p>
    <p>High performance costs energy and fairness  Wireless users demand high throughput, but   A high throughput device needs less sleep.</p>
    <p>A channel allocation mechanism can favor some but degrade performance of others.</p>
    <p>Can we win both instead of addressing the trade-off?</p>

    <p>AP due to distance and obstacle condition differences.  A low speed station has low channel utilization rate.</p>
    <p>Waste energy while a station is waiting for its turn.  Idle communication power due to strong dependency</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Existing Solutions to address the Limits</p>
    <p>Reducing idle communication power by  Traffic prediction: bounded slowdown (MOBICOM02)</p>
    <p>Self-tuning with application hints (MOBICOM03)</p>
    <p>Limits: case by case, and accuracy can vary.</p>
    <p>Address the performance anomaly  Time-based fairness scheduling: a constant time unit is</p>
    <p>given to each device (USENIX 04)</p>
    <p>Limits: poorly conditioned devices suffer: fast is faster, and slow is slower.</p>
    <p>Our work: to win both performance and energy</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Source of Idle Communication Power While the channel is used by one station, idle communication power is wasted in many other stations</p>
    <p>AP</p>
    <p>Wireless performance anomaly makes this power waste worse, but also with an opportunity.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Multi-hop Relays Leverage Strong Dependency  Slow stations become faster</p>
    <p>Completing the data transfer ahead of the unit time.  Equivalent to move the station closer to AP or improve the</p>
    <p>stations communication condition.</p>
    <p>Faster stations serve as proxies for slow stations  Performance improvement of slow stations reduced the</p>
    <p>waste of idle communication powers of fast stations --shortening the waiting time.</p>
    <p>Effective P2P coordination among stations is the key.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Incentive and Fairness to Fast Stations</p>
    <p>Why not sleep or wait, but proxy/relay for others?  Sleep lowers throughput, and wait wastes energy.  Idle communication energy can be used</p>
    <p>The saved time in slow stations should be contributed.</p>
    <p>How much service is fair in a shared radio channel?  A proxy should be paid for its service</p>
    <p>For either proxy or client, the throughput and energy utilization should be improved.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Rationale</p>
    <p>Energy efficiency: what does a user care about?  Energy per second</p>
    <p>Energy per bit: time is energy  Self-incentive multi-hop relay with TBF</p>

    <p>Basic Idea of Token-based Channel Scheduling</p>
    <p>A token is a ticket for a data transfer (RX/TX) in one time unit</p>
    <p>AP initially distributes an equal amount of tokens to each station (fairness).</p>
    <p>A pair of RX &amp; TX consumes one token.  Token bucket model to fully use transmission</p>
    <p>channel.  Multi-hop forwarding to increase throughput  Incentive rewards to proxies</p>

    <p>Put Them Together: Selfish Forwarding - SFW</p>
    <p>Proxy discovery and selection  A poorly conditioned client broadcasts a request to relay his</p>
    <p>packets</p>
    <p>AP assigns a relaying station for clients based on the game theory (second price auction) to provide fairness for competition among proxy candidates</p>
    <p>Channel scheduling  AP distributes tokens for fairness without any enforcement.</p>
    <p>The replaying actions are determined by token exchanges among stations.</p>
