    <p>Service abuse in social networks today</p>
    <p>Several black-market services are available today to Manipulate content ratings Manipulate popularity of a user</p>
    <p>Like spammers try to boost popularity of Facebook pages</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Service abuse in social networks today</p>
    <p>Service abuse can have significant economic consequences</p>
    <p>Social advertising services also seem to be targeted by attackers</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Our goal</p>
    <p>Detect misbehaving identities in a social networking service Suspend the misbehaving user or nullify their actions</p>

    <p>Limitations of existing approaches</p>
    <p>Relies on detecting specific known patterns of misbehavior</p>
    <p>Attackers mutate and use diverse strategies today: Fake accounts are created for Sybil attacks Some real users tend to collude to boost each others popularity Real user accounts are compromised for better social reach</p>
    <p>Existing approaches are vulnerable against an adaptive attacker</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Idea: Use anomaly detection on user behavior</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Our approach at a high level</p>
    <p>We build an Anomaly classifier That learns normal patterns of user behavior Any behavior that deviates significantly from normal is anomalous</p>
    <p>Our technique is unsupervised Learning only requires behavior of unlabeled random sample of users</p>
    <p>This approach has the potential to catch diverse attacker strategies Because we do not require any a priori knowledge of attacker strategy</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Contributions</p>
    <p>An approach to identify anomalous user behavior Without requiring any a priori knowledge of attacker strategy</p>
    <p>Detect like spammers on Facebook who use diverse strategies: Using Sybil accounts Compromised accounts Colluding accounts</p>
    <p>Detect fraudulent clicks in the Facebook social ad platform Observe that a significant fraction of clicks look anomalous</p>

    <p>Learning normal patterns of behavior</p>
    <p>For our approach to work: We have to learn normal patterns of user behavior</p>
    <p>If user behavior is too noisy - i.e., everyone behaves very differently Attacker can potentially hide in the noise and evade detection</p>
    <p>We want to see if there are a few patterns of behavior that are dominant among normal users</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Why would this work against attackers?</p>
    <p>To evade detection, attacker would have to behave normally Will have to limit himself to the few patterns of normal behavior This constrains the attacker and bounds the scale of the attack</p>

    <p>Challenges in modeling behavior</p>
    <p>How do you model complex user behavior in social networks?</p>
    <p>User behavior is high dimensional Number of likes for different page categories Time-series of number of likes per day</p>
    <p>User behavior can change over time</p>
    <p>User behavior can be noisy</p>

    <p>Corroboration by Facebook</p>
    <p>We analyzed the state of flagged users and their likes in June 2014</p>
    <p>Users: Most of the flagged users still exist 92% of black-market and 93% of ad users are still alive</p>
    <p>Likes: Confirms click-spam findings (where there was no ground-truth) More than 85% of all likes by ad users were removed after 4 months</p>
    <p>But Facebooks system is still behind on removing a lot of misbehavior Over 48% of likes by black-market users still exist after 10 months</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Service abuse is a huge problem in social networks today Attackers use diverse strategies and also tend to adapt</p>
    <p>We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection scheme PCA serves as a nice tool to model behavior and detect anomalous ones</p>
    <p>We evaluate our technique on extensive ground-truth data of anomalous behavior</p>
    <p>We apply our approach to detect click-spam in a social ad platform</p>
