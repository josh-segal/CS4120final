    <p>Evaluation: Boxers net effect end to end.</p>
    <p>We report results from an app that allowed users flagged by their system to verify themselves with Boxer.</p>
    <p>For two weeks in February 2020, 45 users were sent to Boxer for verification.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Evaluation: Boxers net effect end to end.</p>
    <p>A manual review by the app later confirmed all 35 users to have been fraudulent.</p>

    <p>Evaluation: Boxers net effect end to end.</p>
    <p>Of the remaining users, 8 passed Boxers challenge and were allowed to complete their transactions.</p>
    <p>A manual review conducted by the app later confirmed Boxers decisions to be accurate.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Evaluation: Boxers net effect end to end.</p>
    <p>Of the remaining 2 users, one was caught by Boxers secure counter and the other was flagged by Boxers screen detection.</p>
    <p>The user caught by secure counter was confirmed by manual review to be a fraudster.</p>
    <p>The other user caught by screen detection was confirmed to be a false positive by manual review.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Evaluation: Boxers net effect end to end.</p>
    <p>Thus, Boxer recovered 89% of the apps legitimate users without incurring additional fraud.</p>

    <p>Impact</p>
    <p>So far 323 apps have integrated Boxer, many of them have deployed Boxer in production.</p>
    <p>Boxer has scanned over 10 million cards and is currently actively stopping fraud.</p>
