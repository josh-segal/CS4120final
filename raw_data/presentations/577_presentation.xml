    <p>Enterprise traffic remains mostly unexplored  Logistically difficult to monitor</p>
    <p>Enterprises are often viewed as working well enough</p>
    <p>Data:</p>
    <p>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</p>
    <p>October 2005  March 2006</p>
    <p>Captured at switches, often switched to new set of ports</p>
    <p>351 distinct hosts monitored ( 4% of total)</p>
    <p>292 million intra-enterprise TCP packets</p>
