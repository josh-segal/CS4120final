    <p>Problem: We are simply storing more passwords than we really need or are capable of dealing with. (Proposed) Solution: A method that enables users to get passwords that are worthy of temporary using, but not quite worthy of preserving.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we explore the design of a system for ephemeral passwords based on a Synthetic Aperture Multimodal Biometric Authentication method, called SAMBA. SAMBA borrows, by analogy, the synthetic aperture technique used in radio/optical astronomy [3, 8] whereby multiple cameras and sensors can be combined together in order to create a synthetic aperture that provides a greater image than any single sensor would ever be capable of. The idea of combining multiple sources of data in order to fuse together a single bigger picture has also been applied in personality assessment [13] and here we propose it as a method for verifying the identity of a user by fusing many smaller biometric samples before releasing an ephemeral password to this user. This password can be used to gain access to a Web account owned by the user. By using our system, users can request an ephemeral password every time they need one, use it, and then forget about it.</p>

Fortunately, he recently installed our system on his smart phone and his two wearable devices (watch, ring). So, he asks our system for an ephemeral password Wells Fargo can accept. Our system asks SAMBA to verify if this request is coming from Peter. If he is, then it releases a new password for him. Otherwise, the system immediately locks the smart phone. In the normal case, Peter gets his new password, uses it, pays his bill, leaves the website, and pretends this password never existed.</p>

    <p>Releasing ephemeral passwords is difficult: The biggest issue is adoption Consequently, we provide a wrapper mechanism that works with existing authentication infrastructures  Based on self-service password reset  Naive approach (additional work is needed) Rationale: It avoids a complete overhaul of Websites cryptography systems to support our solution.</p>
