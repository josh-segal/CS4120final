    <p>The UCL president election (cnt.)</p>
    <p>Election specifics</p>
    <p>I 1-out-of-n election</p>
    <p>I Absolute majority is needed to win, two rounds maximum</p>
    <p>I Vote is not mandatory I Sophisticated vote weighting rules : (simplified a lot)</p>
    <p>I 4 categories of voters Faculty, Researchers, Administrative Staff and Students</p>
    <p>I F have 61% of the electoral votes I R, A, S receive 13% each I restrictions apply on sufficient participation rates</p>
    <p>the weight of each vote depends on the global turnout</p>

    <p>How to make this work ?</p>
    <p>Observations</p>
    <p>I A university is a nice place to try something new</p>
    <p>I Voters arent necessarily computer scientists</p>
    <p>I Voters have UCL email address, login/password, member card</p>
    <p>I Open-source and free starting point system needed (trust, versatility, time frame)</p>

    <p>Helios 1.0 [Adida 2008]</p>
    <p>Principles</p>
    <p>I Browser-only voting system</p>
    <p>I Low-coercion elections I Design kept as simple as possible :</p>
    <p>I Booth can be used as many times as desired</p>
    <p>I ElGamal encryption of 0/1 for each choice I Benaloh challenge</p>
    <p>cast or audit, authenticate on cast</p>
    <p>I Sako-Kilian mixnet before decryption I Web bulletin-board shows votes and proofs for everything</p>
    <p>I Deployed on Google App Engine</p>

    <p>UCL Crypto Group Microelectronics Laboratory EVT/WOTE 09 - August 11, 2009 9</p>
    <p>Technical Challenges (1/3)</p>
    <p>Key management</p>
    <p>I Vote confidentiality relies on control of ElGamal private key Move to distributed ElGamal</p>
    <p>I Trustees are not computer scientists</p>
    <p>Distribute trust among experts Use LiveCD, disk- and network-free laptops Monitoring/Audit by independent company</p>

    <p>UCL Crypto Group Microelectronics Laboratory EVT/WOTE 09 - August 11, 2009 10</p>
    <p>Technical Challenges (2/3)</p>
    <p>Vote weighting</p>
    <p>I Participation per category and weights are public But support of candidates per category is secret</p>
    <p>We cannot open individual votes ! Move to homomorphic tally instead of mixnets</p>
    <p>I Not enough to hide support of candidates per category. . .</p>
    <p>wFnF + wRnR + wAnA + wSns = n</p>
    <p>. . . has  1 solution for UCL election parameters (knapsack-style problem)</p>
    <p>Use smaller, approximate weights Careful choice provided  105 sol. for  104 precision</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>UCL Crypto Group Microelectronics Laboratory EVT/WOTE 09 - August 11, 2009 11</p>
    <p>Technical Challenges (3/3)</p>
    <p>Audit complaints arbitration I Voters invited to complain if WBB looks wrong</p>
    <p>DoS through complaints ? Give voters a way to prove things are wrong</p>
    <p>Timestamp/sign everything as evidence</p>
    <p>I Voters usually not familiar with signature Signed pdf files seem most usable Signature through PortableSigner</p>
    <p>UCL Root certificate deployed on all UCL machines</p>

    <p>Privacy matters</p>
    <p>I Publication of privacy policies Help of law office</p>
    <p>I Name of voters cannot appear on bulletin board Each voter receives an alias</p>
    <p>I Google App Engine constraining : data sent out of EU Move to Django/PostgreSQL for free software stack</p>

    <p>Usability</p>
    <p>I Make voting process as straightforward as possible Keep information available for curious voter</p>
    <p>Robustness and availability</p>
    <p>I Each election round lasts 35 hours Use redundant in-house servers</p>
    <p>Use cloud computing (Amazon EC2)</p>

    <p>Voter behavior I 1% vote more than once (last vote counts)</p>
    <p>Quite controversial, no strong impact I 3% use voting offices</p>
    <p>Mostly people unfamiliar with PC Quite over-dimensioned on our side</p>
    <p>I 30% check their vote on web bulletin board Quite high !</p>
    <p>Decreases on 2nd round I 120 tickets raised by UCL support</p>
    <p>Importance of testing with broad spectrum of people. . .</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>I 1st significant-outcome, multi-thousand-voters open-audit election successful</p>
    <p>I Open-audit elections allow moving I from election manipulation opportunity I to voter verification opportunity</p>
    <p>I Each election is a significant project on its own Thanks to all the people at who supported it !</p>
