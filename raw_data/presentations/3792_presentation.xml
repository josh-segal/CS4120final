    <p>Ski Rental Problem, cont.</p>
    <p>Offline setting is trivial</p>
    <p>Online setting:</p>
    <p>Best deterministic online algorithm: rent for s  1 days and buy on day s. This strategy is (2  1s )-competitive</p>
    <p>(Karlin, Manasse, Sleator, FOCS 86) (Karp, IFIP 92)</p>
    <p>Best randomized online algorithm (chooses a random day from {1, . . . , s} and then buys on this day) is ee1  1.58-competitive</p>
