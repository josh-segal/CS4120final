    <p>Five Questions</p>
    <p>How are servers deployed?</p>
    <p>Can our apps handle it?</p>
    <p>When should we expand?</p>
    <p>When do we contract?</p>
    <p>What tooling do we use?</p>

    <p>How Are Servers Deployed?</p>
    <p>Elasticity Requires Automation</p>

    <p>When Should We Expand? When Should We Contract?</p>

    <p>Elasticity Requires Open Metrics</p>
    <p>Open Metrics Require Culture Change</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What Does This Have to Do With DevOps?</p>
    <p>Be a professional</p>
    <p>Share and collaborate on information and resources</p>
    <p>Build trust</p>
    <p>Consider surrendering unilaterally</p>
    <p>Compromise</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Why is Communication Essential?</p>
    <p>Operations does not understand the application</p>
    <p>Development does not understand the environment</p>
    <p>Everyone assumes that their understanding of the problem is complete</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Metrics Through Collaboration</p>
    <p>Provide Operational Logs to developers</p>
    <p>Request structured data in logs developers provide to Operations</p>
    <p>Key question: what are the pain points for each group?</p>
    <p>Monitor everything, but dont focus on what doesnt matter until youve managed the rest</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Can Our Apps Handle It?</p>
    <p>Scale Out, Not Up</p>
    <p>Latency in the cloud is not high or low - its variable</p>
    <p>What is your ROI on additional nodes?</p>
    <p>Linear</p>
    <p>Logarithmic</p>

    <p>Be Prepared for Change</p>

    <p>Be Prepared for Change</p>
    <p>Bottlenecks will move inside your stack</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Be Prepared for Change</p>
    <p>Bottlenecks will move inside your stack</p>
    <p>Have a process for accepting and handling the changes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>When Should We Expand? When Do We Contract?</p>
    <p>Blind automation can be dangerous</p>
    <p>Impose sanity limits on builds and teardowns</p>
    <p>How many can I provision/destroy?</p>
    <p>How fast can I provision/destroy?</p>
    <p>Alert humans in edge cases</p>
    <p>Consider a pool of offline servers to speed operation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Tooling (The Short Version)</p>
    <p>Network</p>
    <p>DHCP, PXE, DNS, OS and Patch provisioning all must have APIs or script-based management</p>
    <p>OS</p>
    <p>Cobbler, Spacewalk, Foreman</p>
    <p>Configuration Management</p>
    <p>Puppet! (but seriously, please use something)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Tying It All Together</p>
    <p>Youve already done the hard work</p>
    <p>Servers can be provisioned based on</p>
    <p>Metrics agreed upon by business, dev and ops</p>
    <p>API-based tooling around infrastructure and automated deployment</p>
    <p>What next?</p>
    <p>Ticketing and change control/review</p>
    <p>Integration testing</p>
