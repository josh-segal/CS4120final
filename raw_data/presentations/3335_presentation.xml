    <p>Best- and better-response dynamics</p>
    <p>Consider the best-response (or better-response) dynamics of a normal-form game:</p>
    <p>2, 2</p>
    <p>2, 2</p>
    <p>Pure NE = no outbound edges</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Convergence to pure Nash</p>
    <p>Existence of pure Nash is good, but will the game converge to one? Some kinds of games always converge to pure Nash:</p>
    <p>congestion/potential games [Rosenthal73; Monderer&amp;Shapley 96] ordinal potential games (fully general for better-response) dominance-solvable games [Moulin 79]</p>
    <p>But what of games that dont always converge?</p>
