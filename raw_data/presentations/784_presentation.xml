  <div class="page">
    <p>Penetration testing course</p>
    <p>Masters course</p>
    <p>Taught at University of Birmingham, UK</p>
    <p>Two practical assignments</p>
    <p>Analysing commercial off-the-shelf IoT devices</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Learning objectives</p>
    <p>Collect and analyse network traffic</p>
    <p>Understand commonly used network protocols</p>
    <p>Simple reverse engineering of code</p>
    <p>Perform penetration tests of IoT devices</p>
    <p>Present results of a penetration test in form of a report and presentation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>Introduction to penetration testing</p>
    <p>Relevant standards (e.g. PCI-DSS, NIST SP800-115)</p>
    <p>Legal and ethical issues</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Analysing network traffic</p>
    <p>Web security  Common attacks: SQLi, XSS, CSRF  Burp Proxy to intercept, view and alter web traffic  Practical exercise with VM running vulnerable web</p>
    <p>application</p>
    <p>Network protocols  HTTP and TLS  Network scanning with Nmap  Capturing of network traffic using Wireshark  TLS man-in-the-middle using Burp Proxy</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Reverse engineering</p>
    <p>Android / Java apps  Apktool, dex2jar and JD-GUI tools introduced  Tools useful for group assignment</p>
    <p>x86 binaries  IDA Pro  Buffer overflows</p>
    <p>Practical exercise on buffer overflows</p>

    <p>Practical assignments</p>
    <p>Analysis of commercial off-the-shelf IoT devices</p>
    <p>Results in report and presentation</p>
    <p>Students signed declaration  Only analysis of device and app, no backends  No publicity without permission from staff</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>First group assignment</p>
    <p>Analysis of vulnerable IoT device</p>
    <p>Groups of 4</p>
    <p>Lasted for 4 weeks</p>
    <p>Individual group meetings to discuss progress</p>
    <p>Lab session to get help with the tools</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Vulnerable devices</p>
    <p>Easy to find vulnerabilities  Known vulnerabilities  Found during quick manual analysis</p>
    <p>Can be during setup  For example, sending Wi-Fi credentials over</p>
    <p>unprotected Wi-Fi connection</p>
    <p>Or when device is used  For example, improper use of TLS</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Results first assignment</p>
    <p>All groups found some vulnerability</p>
    <p>Findings were presented to class  Demos given of found attacks</p>
    <p>Reports were peer reviewed by students</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Student reviews</p>
    <p>Reports of first assignments were reviewed and ranked by all students</p>
    <p>One paragraph per reviewed report  Not taken into account for grade of reviewed report</p>
    <p>Review reports were part of the final grade</p>
    <p>Useful exercise for the students</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Second group assignment</p>
    <p>Different groups  Knowledge sharing</p>
    <p>Unknown whether devices were vulnerable</p>
    <p>Less guidance</p>
    <p>Grade based on report  Finding vulnerability not necessary for good grade</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Results second assignment</p>
    <p>New vulnerabilities found  Home alarm system: app used same credentials over</p>
    <p>TLS and plaintext connection  Smart padlock: validity period only checked by app and</p>
    <p>master code provided to guest users  Smart camera: face recognition fooled using Facebook</p>
    <p>pictures</p>
    <p>Knowledge shared after first exercise</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Grading</p>
    <p>Practical assignments</p>
    <p>Analysis of device functionality (25%)  Risk analysis (10%)</p>
    <p>Substantialness of achievement (15%)  Report (20%)  Presentation (20%)</p>
    <p>Teamwork (10%)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Grading</p>
    <p>Final grade</p>
    <p>Written exercises (10%)  First practical assignment (40%)  Peer reviews (10%)  Second practical assignment (40%)</p>
    <p>No students failed</p>
    <p>Distribution of marks comparable to other courses</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Student feedback</p>
    <p>Course very well received</p>
    <p>Maximum score for  How worthwhile course was  The amount learned  How interesting course was</p>
    <p>Rated slightly harder than average</p>
    <p>Practical aspects, learned skills and use of real IoT devices especially appreciated</p>
    <p>Students would have liked more time for analysis</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>IoT devices provide good learning material to teach penetration testing techniques  All groups found vulnerabilities</p>
    <p>Having two rounds improved knowledge sharing  First round builds confidence that the students can find</p>
    <p>vulnerabilities</p>
    <p>Course very well received by the students</p>
