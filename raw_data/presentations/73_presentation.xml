    <p>Economics &amp; the Internet Inertness</p>
    <p>Internet infrastructure is insecure</p>
    <p>Despite the obvious threat, countermeasures are not being deployed  E.g., Secure-BGP</p>
    <p>We argue that the reason is mainly economic</p>
    <p>Autonomous systems (ASes) in commercial Internet are independent, rational, and pay-off maximizing entities</p>

    <p>Overview</p>
    <p>Economic Case for Pluralism</p>
    <p>Architectural Framework for Pluralism</p>
    <p>Example of Using the Architectural Framework</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Background: Economics of Groups and Goods</p>
    <p>Good: Secure communication between domains  Goods are confidentiality, integrity, and availability</p>
    <p>Producing such goods requires action in groups  Group members are ASes</p>
    <p>Goods can be  purely public (e.g., public television broadcasting)</p>
    <p>purely private (e.g., recorded music sold in stores)</p>
    <p>impurely public (e.g., cable television broadcasting)</p>
    <p>Type of good can be engineered</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Background: Routing Protocols</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The Case for Pluralism: Purism is not Economically Viable</p>
    <p>Purism: Ubiquitous deployment of a secure routing protocol</p>
    <p>Purism treats secure interdomain communication as a pure public good  Therefore, purism is not economically viable</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The Case for Pluralism: Smaller Groups are More Effective</p>
    <p>Olson classifies interaction among group members in three categories:  Large group; good will not be provided</p>
    <p>unless there is coercion</p>
    <p>Small group; good may be provided by unilateral action</p>
    <p>Medium group; good may be provided by strategic interaction</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The Case for Pluralism: Custom Security Solutions Per Group</p>
    <p>Many options (mechanisms) to improve communication security  E.g., confidentiality can be protected by a secure</p>
    <p>routing protocol or encryption ciphers</p>
    <p>No single mechanism can address the full gamut of threats  E.g., during a DoS attack you prefer unreachability</p>
    <p>Network architecture should support the graceful coexistence of different mechanisms</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>SBone Architectural Framework for Pluralism</p>
    <p>Objective: support the formation of groups of any size---irrespective of IP connectivity of group members---without compromising security</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Formation of Arbitrary Groups Irrespective of IP Connectivity</p>
    <p>island</p>
    <p>Archipelago</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Threat Model</p>
    <p>DoS attacks  against targets inside the overlay  against virtual links</p>
    <p>Routing-protocol attacks  to intercept cross-island traffic</p>
    <p>Data-plane attacks  to manipulate cross-island traffic</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Secure Virtual Link: Surelink</p>
    <p>Connects a relay point in one island to a relay point in another forming an IP tunnel</p>
    <p>Surelinks enhance the service model of a vanilla IP tunnel with  an encryption cipher to protect confidentiality</p>
    <p>an authentication cipher to protect integrity and enforce access control</p>
    <p>secure availability monitoring capability</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Secure Virtual Topology</p>
    <p>Collection of multiple surelinks giving control of the underlying paths traffic takes</p>
    <p>Path control can be leveraged to  proactively prevent routing attacks</p>
    <p>proactively bypass untrusted non-participants</p>
    <p>proactively spread traffic over multiple paths</p>
    <p>reactively reroute traffic to alternate paths</p>

    <p>Coalition-based trusted VPNs can serve multinational customers without additional investment on infrastructure</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Purism is not economically viable</p>
    <p>Deployment of communication security mechanism should be based on pluralism;  I.e., the formation of variable-sized groups deploying</p>
    <p>mechanism customized to group-specific needs</p>
    <p>Proposed an architectural framework to support pluralism that is backward compatible with existing infrastructure</p>
