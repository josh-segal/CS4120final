  <div class="page">
    <p>Basic embedding model: ComplEx</p>
    <p>Entity and relation representations: complex-valued vectors</p>
    <p>Triple scoring function: multi-linear dot product</p>
    <p>Triples with higher scores are more likely to be true</p>
    <p>Entity:  = +</p>
    <p>Re  Im</p>
    <p>Relation:  = +</p>

    <p>Non-negativity of entity representations</p>
    <p>Intuition</p>
    <p>Uneconomical to store negative properties of an entity/concept</p>
    <p>Non-negativity constraints</p>
    <p>Positive properties of cats  Cats are mammals  Cats eat fishes  Cats have four legs</p>
    <p>Negative properties of cats  Cats are not vehicles  Cats do not have wheels  Cats are not used for communication</p>

    <p>Approximate entailment for relations</p>
    <p>Approximate entailment</p>
    <p>: relation  approximately entails relation  with confidence level</p>
    <p>: a person born in a country is very likely, but not necessarily, to have a nationality of that country</p>
