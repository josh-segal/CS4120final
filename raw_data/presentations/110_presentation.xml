    <p>The all-pairs algorithm (brute force)</p>
    <p>Given a set of wireless devices moving in a simulated scenario, at</p>
    <p>each timestep the simulator has to determine the whole set of each timestep, the simulator has to determine the whole set of</p>
    <p>hosts affected by the ongoing transmissions</p>
    <p>In a simplistic way this problem can be solved by computing the</p>
    <p>distance between each pair of nodes. This algorithm is usually</p>
    <p>efe ed to as all pairs (b te fo ce) and has a comple it of referred to as all-pairs (brute force) and has a complexity of</p>
    <p>O(n2) per timestep</p>

    <p>By exploiting the homogeneous limited horizon distance</p>
    <p>assumption of wireless transmissions, it is possible to reduce the</p>

    <p>By assuming a 2-D space, in the worst case four comparisons are</p>
    <p>necessary to determine if a point falls within a square: the</p>
    <p>evaluation of the Euclidean distance is much more costly!</p>

    <p>Grid-based data structure</p>
    <p>An overlay grid divides the simulated space in cells. Each square</p>
    <p>of the grid (or cell) represents only a small portion of the of the grid (or cell) represents only a small portion of the</p>
    <p>simulated scenario and has a fixed size</p>
    <p>The overlay grid is composed by a y g p y matrix of separate chaining hash tables</p>
    <p>Only the grid squares whose area has non zero intersection with the transmission range circle have to be transmission range circle have to be checked</p>
    <p>In this way the number of checks can In this way the number of checks can be drastically reduced, but the data structure management introduces</p>

    <p>Results caching</p>
    <p>The Euclidean distance is a commutative binary operator: given</p>
    <p>two points x and y we have that d(x,y) = d(y,x)</p>
    <p>In a centralized simulation-execution architecture it would be</p>
    <p>possible to reduce the number of Euclidean distance operations to</p>
    <p>n(n-1)/2</p>
    <p>On the other hand, in a distributed simulation, each LP manages</p>
    <p>only a subset of the SMHs and a global knowledge of the</p>
    <p>simulated environment is missing</p>
    <p>A prerequisite to apply the commutative optimization is: in a pair p q pp y p p</p>
    <p>(SMH1, SMH2) both simulated nodes have to be allocated in the</p>
    <p>same LP. Otherwise the results caching can not be applied</p>
