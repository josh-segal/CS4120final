    <p>However, several powerful analysis techniques take time to converge!</p>

    <p>Clustering finds inherent groupings in data As opposed to classification, which learns groupings that user provides</p>
    <p>Document clustering a powerful and versatile technique in unstructured information management</p>
    <p>Several analytics use clustering at their core Organize document collections for management, browsing Organize search results Label document collections automatically</p>

    <p>Clustering takes time Usually linear in the non-zero size of term-document matrix and in number of clusters Depending on how optimized the implementations are, how many clusters are requested, typical unstructured corpora can take minutes to hours</p>
    <p>Usually, clustering-based analytics part of a larger workflow User is frequently waiting for the clustering to provide results Holds up the entire workflow</p>

    <p>k -means</p>
    <p>Arguably most important algorithm for clustering is k -means</p>
    <p>We think of k -means as being in one of two states: Still running (aka, lets get coffee) Converged (aka, lets celebrate)</p>
    <p>But is it really that simple? (will return to this question later)</p>

    <p>Here is the objective function of k -means.</p>
    <p>E(x,) = m</p>
    <p>i=1</p>
    <p>L(xi,j ), (1)</p>
    <p>(k -means minimizes this)</p>
    <p>However, most users do not think in terms of such functions (I hope)</p>
    <p>Most enterprise applications of clustering do not care about this function</p>

    <p>k -means is about documents moving around between clusters</p>
    <p>How does meaning change when a document moves?</p>
    <p>Concept flow when documents move between clusters Ci and Cj .</p>
    <p>We measure the presence of terms in the document that are concept labels for Ci and Cj Take the difference of the two-way deltas when a document moves: this is a measure of the concept flow associated to the movement of the document</p>

    <p>Concept flows can be measured cheaply Text is very high dimensional (1000s of dimensions) But concepts per cluster are few ( 10) Each cluster can be calibrated to measure these</p>

    <p>k -means is a set of pairwise flows, most of which abate early. Labels can be computed by iteration 5. Once flows to and from a cluster have abatedas has happened to Cluster 5, we may extract semantic meaning from it. This can happen very early during run-time, long before final convergence of k -means.</p>
