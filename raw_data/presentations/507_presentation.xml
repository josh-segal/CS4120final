    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Legitimacy of government depends on trustworthy elections.</p>
    <p>Potential for undetected fraud undermines the basis for trust.</p>
    <p>Elections are extremely attractive targets for fraud.</p>
    <p>Attackers may be highly motivated.</p>
    <p>And have access to massive resources.</p>
    <p>Primary responsibility for fraud prevention/detection rests on local election</p>
    <p>officials.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Scope</p>
    <p>Focused on attempts to steal election without detection.</p>
    <p>Injecting fraudulent ballots into system.</p>
    <p>Changing results after ballots are cast.</p>
    <p>Did not consider</p>
    <p>Robbery in broad daylight.</p>
    <p>Mistakes, breakdowns, etc.</p>
    <p>Deniable but detected attacks.</p>
    <p>Vote suppression.</p>
    <p>Misleading campaigns.</p>
    <p>Sabotage of campaigns.</p>
    <p>Etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Importance of procedures</p>
    <p>Even the best election technology cannot prevent fraud.</p>
    <p>Optimal procedures are crucial.</p>
    <p>Physical security of ballots.</p>
    <p>Auditing (broadly construed).</p>
    <p>Public observation (to deter insider attacks).</p>
    <p>Achieving an acceptable level of security is highly nontrivial.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Systematic Threat Evaluation</p>
    <p>Election security is a tough, complex problem.</p>
    <p>How should scarce resources be allocated?</p>
    <p>Need quantitative comparison of threats and countermeasures.</p>
    <p>Which threats to address first?</p>
    <p>At what price?</p>
    <p>Also helps with larger policy debates (e.g., electronic/internet voting).</p>
    <p>But how can we do it?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Proposed solution</p>
    <p>Systematic, quantitative threat modeling at the local level.</p>
    <p>Based on (generalized) attack trees (AttackDog tool).</p>
    <p>Major challenge: How to make it feasible?</p>
    <p>Solution: Tailor a generic, reusable threat model to the particular jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>We tested this idea in Marin County, CA, in the November 2010 general election.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Marin County, CA</p>
    <p>Medium-size county (pop. 242,409) just North of San Francisco (across Golden Gate Bridge).</p>
    <p>With very patient and helpful election officials (esp. Elaine Ginnold  THANKS!)</p>
    <p>Uses precinct-count optical scan voting + central count optical scan.</p>
    <p>Lazarus and Hall</p>
    <p>Interviewed staff.</p>
    <p>Observed on Election Day.</p>
    <p>Observed post-election hand audits.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Threat evaluation methodology</p>
    <p>&lt;Figure out how to explain AttackDog concisely&gt;</p>
    <p>Picture of attack tree, with key concepts?</p>
    <p>Goals, and/or nodes, attack steps</p>
    <p>Attacks, attributes, attack cost.</p>
    <p>Reusable parameterizable subtrees.</p>
    <p>Omit nodes.</p>
    <p>Defense domain.</p>
    <p>Computing attack cost</p>
    <p>COST CAN BE ANYTHING.</p>
    <p>Distinguish CAPABILITIES from APPLICATION in this case.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Attack Team Size (ATS)</p>
    <p>Metric for attack team cost.</p>
    <p>ATS = number of people knowingly involved in the election fraud.</p>
    <p>Justifications</p>
    <p>Major consideration: risk of detection.</p>
    <p>May thwart goal.</p>
    <p>May incur penalties.</p>
    <p>Relatively simple (minimizes number of judgement calls).</p>
    <p>Not misleadingly precise.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Reusable threat model</p>
    <p>Began with very detailed general threat model. Developed over several years.</p>
    <p>Learned from Leon County, FL</p>
    <p>Incorporated aspects of EAC model (TIRA) (Yasinsac).</p>
    <p>Learn jurisdiction-specific details Focus on critical aspects, based on existing tree and knowledge</p>
    <p>(e.g, auditing, physical security).</p>
    <p>Observe procedures in practice.</p>
    <p>Polling place procedures.</p>
    <p>Ballot transportation and storage.</p>
    <p>Auditing procedures.</p>
    <p>Set parameters appropriately</p>
    <p>Change model (hopefully, not much).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Model adaptations for Marin</p>
    <p>Parameters</p>
    <p>Estimated # of voters, polling places.</p>
    <p># of poll workers/polling place.</p>
    <p># of members of each ballot counting team during manual audit.</p>
    <p>Qualitative parameters (stringency of tamper evidence measures and audit procedures).</p>
    <p>Election assumptions: Margin of victory, # of votes that can be stolen in a precinct or</p>
    <p>machine without being obvious.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Model extension</p>
    <p>Ballots are transported from polling places to election office in two stages:</p>
    <p>Poll workers take ballot boxes to drop-off centers.</p>
    <p>Many boxes are loaded into trucks for transportation to final destination.</p>
    <p>This has an impact on ATS, because small teams have access to many ballots</p>
    <p>during the second stage of transportation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Computer security is useless*</p>
    <p>There are infinitely many ways to subvert computer systems with ATS = 1.</p>
    <p>Securing machines is hopeless (from this perspective).</p>
    <p>Only hope for increasing ATS is to used audited software independent systems.</p>
    <p>(We did not evaluate computer security in Marin.)</p>
    <p>*for increasing ATS</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Malware attack</p>
    <p>Subvert voting technology</p>
    <p>Make voting machines cheat using malware.</p>
    <p>Steps: Write malware, insert malware, evade testing, etc.</p>
    <p>Must also defeat California manual auditing process of paper ballots.</p>
    <p>Tamper with paper ballots during transportation or</p>
    <p>storage.</p>
    <p>Insider attacks on audit process.</p>
    <p>Non-random precinct choice.</p>
    <p>Defeat comparison of hand count with committed total.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Vote by mail attacks</p>
    <p>Obvious: Election office insiders could discard ballots (1 insider).</p>
    <p>Less obvious: Stolen registration attack</p>
    <p>Small number of attackers registers many legal but never-registered voters (1 insider at</p>
    <p>Dept. of Moter Vehicles has this info).</p>
    <p>Requests absentee ballots be sent to various addresses.</p>
    <p>Small team fills out many ballots and mails them in.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Weighted attack team size</p>
    <p>Alternative metric: Insiders are more costly than outsiders on attack team.</p>
    <p>Rationale: Insiders are harder to recruit, may be more carefully vetted.</p>
    <p>We tried: 1 insider = 10 outsiders (easy in AttackDog).</p>
    <p>Shifts low-cost attacks to outsiders</p>
    <p>Subverting audited ballots  2 outsiders.</p>
    <p>Discarding VbM ballots  10 (1 insider).</p>
    <p>VbM registration theft  8 outsiders.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Discussion</p>
    <p>Threat evaluation with reusable threat models may be practical.</p>
    <p>Even with paper ballot systems and audit requirements, security is tough.</p>
    <p>Physical security of ballots.</p>
    <p>Auditing is very sensitive to procedural details.</p>
    <p>This study is a first step, not a solution.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Future</p>
    <p>Tool improvements</p>
    <p>More efficient evaluation under multiple scenarios.</p>
    <p>Better summarization of possible attacks.</p>
    <p>General productization</p>
    <p>Make the problem simpler</p>
    <p>Simplified elections.</p>
    <p>Standardized security for election jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>Individual ballot auditing.</p>
