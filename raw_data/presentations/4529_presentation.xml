    <p>Through collaboration with WVU Eye Institute Through collaboration with WVU Eye Institute (EI), we have collected a set of nonideal iris (EI), we have collected a set of nonideal iris images for a total of around 100 subjectsimages for a total of around 100 subjects  4 images captured for each eye (~800 images in 4 images captured for each eye (~800 images in</p>
