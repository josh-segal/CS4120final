    <p>DNS Tampering IP Header Filtering (address or protocol) IP Content Filtering (keyword or protocol) Proxy Filtering</p>
    <p>We might also consider takedown, social pressure, legislation as means of filtering, but will focus on technological approaches.</p>

    <p>Limitations There are limitations to filtering technologies.</p>
    <p>A rough tradeoff between subtlety of approach and computational requirements.</p>
    <p>In general, more sophisticated methods require greater computational resources. At a national scale, these can become severe.</p>
    <p>Centralization of filtering can cause a variety of problems, as seen with the CleanFeed filter implemented by BT in the UK.</p>
    <p>Centrally managing filtering can also raise significant administrative and organizational burdens.</p>

    <p>Localized Filtering Countries may delegate filtering to ISPs or local areas, either for efficiency or to specifically allow localized control.</p>
    <p>We can already observe location-specific choices of filtering in response to local events.</p>
    <p>We therefore expect to see differences in filtering across a state, rather than homogeneous national filtering.</p>
    <p>Naturally, we also expect filtering to vary over time. We may also expect organizations to have one filtering regime, even across a state.</p>

    <p>For fine-grained mapping we wish to combine data gathered at various locations in a state, or around the world, with GeoIP data at the city level.</p>
    <p>GeoIP databases are increasingly cheap and accurate.</p>
    <p>The problem is therefore to get a large number of readings from a wide geographical distribution.</p>
    <p>Ideally, not just blocking status but type of blocking.</p>

    <p>For fine-grained mapping we wish to combine data gathered at various locations in a state, or around the world, with GeoIP data at the city level.</p>
    <p>GeoIP databases are increasingly cheap and accurate.</p>
    <p>The problem is therefore to get a large number of readings from a wide geographical distribution.</p>
    <p>Ideally, not just blocking status but type of blocking.</p>

    <p>China seems to offer no exit nodes. Much of Africa and the Middle East is the same. No-one wants to run Tor-like services in highly filtered areas!</p>

    <p>Retrieved a list of 278 DNS servers across China from the APNIC WHOIS database.</p>
    <p>Selected the top 80 reported blocked websites according to HERDICT.</p>

    <p>Early Observations</p>
    <p>Results have not yet been analysed, but some initial observations:</p>
    <p>Many blocked sites are listed an non-existent in the majority of DNS servers tested.</p>
    <p>Several servers return no result for most blocked sites, but occasionally redirect requests to other DNS servers before doing so.</p>
    <p>One server in Zhongxin returns a normal response for baidu.com.cn, but redirects to a Beijing server when asked about wujie.net, which then returns no result.</p>

    <p>What are the legal and, importantly, ethical limits to what we can do in this area?</p>
    <p>What good services exist from which to bounce connections?</p>
