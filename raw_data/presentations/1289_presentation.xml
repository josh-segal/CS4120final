    <p>Introduction and Motivation  The way that businesses work is changing...  Organizations are becoming more specialized  Increased outsourcing of IT applications to reduce costs  Social Web technologies are eroding organizational silos  Employees (users) are increasingly Internet savvy</p>
    <p>These trends are driving the next generation of collaboration tools...  Lightweight  Cloud-based  Effective within and between organizations  Put the user, rather than the IT dept, at the centre and in control</p>
    <p>The Fractal Project at HP Labs Bristol was established in May 2009 to explore this space.</p>

    <p>Conceptual Prototype: Goals  Refine our vision for Fractal, using a scenario</p>
    <p>based on a collaborative pharmaceutical research project involving several organizations</p>
    <p>Evaluate several current technologies as possible starting points for Fractal</p>
    <p>Explore the feasibility of end-user created active behaviors with current technologies</p>
    <p>Explore how such extensions might by published through an extensions marketplace</p>
    <p>Derive key platform requirements</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Technology Evaluation  Technologies: Alfresco  Enterprise Content Management Drupal/Joomla  Content driven web applications Liferay  Enterprise Portal TikiWiki  Collaboration / Groupware</p>
    <p>Criteria: strong document management features embedded workflow engine social capabilities (blogs, wikis, tagging) user interface features matching our ideas for Fractal</p>
    <p>Conclusion: Alfresco Share was the best option</p>

    <p>Prototype Walk Through Content Spaces are hosted collaborative</p>
    <p>spaces that bind together people, content and active behaviours in a highly social context.</p>
    <p>All customization is readily accessible to end users.</p>
    <p>The Fractal Extensions Marketplace provides a community space to share</p>
    <p>and discover extensions.</p>
    <p>Active behaviors allow custom functionality to be added to content spaces</p>
    <p>to adapt them to the task at hand.</p>

    <p>Requirements for Large Scale Multi-Tenancy What is a tenant?</p>
    <p>Multi-tenancy refers to the ability to support multiple independent customers on a single software instance</p>
    <p>Multi-tenancy is usually defined along organizational boundaries: a tenant is typically a company, or an organization however, this impedes collaboration between companies,</p>
    <p>because there are no shared spaces  To better support collaboration between organizations,</p>
    <p>its necessary to define a tenant differently a tenant simply becomes a collaborative context users need to be visible globally, but still valuable to</p>
    <p>manage them locally within organizations</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Requirements for Large Scale Multi-Tenancy Providing Isolation between Tenants</p>
    <p>Isolation at the Data level each tenant's data should be managed securely and</p>
    <p>independently from other tenants for some tenants, logical isolation may be sufficient for others, isolation might be needed all the way down to</p>
    <p>the storage level</p>
    <p>Isolation at the Application level one tenants use of particular extensions should not in any</p>
    <p>way pollute (or put at risk) other tenants</p>
    <p>Isolation at the Performance level one tenants heavy use of the service should not impact</p>
    <p>the quality of service provided to other tenants</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Requirements for Large Scale Multi-Tenancy Maintaining levels of service</p>
    <p>Provide multiple levels of service different tenants will have different requirements, and</p>
    <p>different abilities to pay many aspects of the service (capacity, bandwidth,</p>
    <p>processing, consistency, replication, versioning) should be configurable on a per-tenant basis</p>
    <p>Resource usage tracking has several benefits: allows usage based pricing models allows excessively heavy usage to be throttled allows poorly written applications to be detected  in general, acts as a form of demand management</p>
