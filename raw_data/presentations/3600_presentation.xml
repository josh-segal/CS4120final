    <p>What do paid TI services consist of?</p>
    <p>Targeted industries, as identified in the</p>
    <p>metadata of reports from two leading providers.</p>
    <p>Threat reports 71%</p>
    <p>Indicators of compromise 71%</p>
    <p>Requests for information 57%</p>
    <p>Portals 50%</p>
    <p>Platforms for data mining and 29% aggregation of open sources</p>
    <p>Custom alerts 14%</p>

    <p>IP s</p>
    <p>Indicator overlap 1.3-13%, depending on</p>
    <p>which vendor you take as denominator.</p>
    <p>For specific threat actors tracked by both</p>
    <p>vendors no more than 2.5-4.0%, depending on type.</p>
    <p>We find largely separate sets, which raises</p>
    <p>questions about coverage of vendors.</p>

    <p>How is paid TI different from open TI?</p>
    <p>Paid TI sources are smaller. Less than 1%</p>
    <p>overlap with 6 open source blocklists.</p>
    <p>No evidence that paid sources are faster.</p>

    <p>Professionals describe paid sources</p>
    <p>as more comprehensive and polished.</p>

    <p>How do customers use TI and perceive value?</p>
    <p>Customers want more curated feeds:</p>
    <p>they seem to be optimizing for the</p>
    <p>workflow of their analysts, not detection.</p>
    <p>TI is mainly used for network detection, but we found also more surprising use cases.</p>
    <p>Inductively gathered value perceptions.</p>

    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>Customers optimize for analyst time</p>
    <p>(low FP) rather than coverage (low FN).</p>
    <p>Identify interesting use cases of TI</p>
    <p>besides network detection.</p>
    <p>Costs of paid providers not a concern.  Value understood through source.</p>
    <p>confidence, relevance, and actionability.</p>
    <p>Between open and paid TI sources</p>
    <p>almost no overlap in indicators.</p>
    <p>Between two leading paid TI vendors</p>
    <p>Even for specific threat actors, the vendors have 2.5-4.0% overlap.</p>
    <p>One-month delay in reporting (small n).</p>

    <p>If you [the attacker] get detected on one</p>
