    <p>Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)</p>
    <p>Traffic Management Commuter Information Intersection control</p>
    <p>- adaptive/static - isolated/co-ordinated</p>
    <p>Infrastructure planning</p>
    <p>Incident handling - detection</p>
    <p>- fine imposition</p>
    <p>Revenue collection</p>
    <p>Pollution control</p>
    <p>Infrastructure maintenance</p>
    <p>Congestion map - historical/real-time</p>
    <p>Travel time - historical/real-time</p>
    <p>Transit tracking - bus/train/metro</p>
    <p>- arrival time prediction</p>
    <p>Cab services - locate nearest - trip fare/duration prediction</p>
    <p>Personal vehicle services - parking spaces - carbon footprint</p>
    <p>And many more ........</p>
    <p>Infrastructure growth is lagging behind growth in vehicle volumes.</p>
    <p>Better traffic management and more information to commuters can alleviate traffic woes, though</p>
    <p>cannot obliterate them. Technology to do this is called ITS.</p>

    <p>Any ITS application would need information from the road. Hence the need for road sensors.</p>

    <p>Wait .... do we need all sensor types?</p>
