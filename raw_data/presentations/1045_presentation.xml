    <p>Container Cloud</p>
    <p>Why container cloud?  Speed</p>
    <p>rapid deployment  faster time-to-market</p>
    <p>Convenience, Simplicity  Portability  Resource efficiency</p>
    <p>Challenges  Security  Robustness/Stability</p>
    <p>isolation guarantee</p>
    <p>Management  Increased deployment density  Monitoring becomes more complex</p>

    <p>Goal of This Work</p>
    <p>Many excellent container scanning tools available  IBM Vulnerability Advisor, Twistlock, Amazon inspector, Docker security scanning, Aqua,</p>
    <p>CoreOS Clair, OpenSCAP</p>
    <p>Goal</p>
    <p>To start understanding what the real cloud looks like in terms of cloud security  What does the security posture look like?  How do people use containers?</p>
    <p>As regular VMs?  As immutable objects?</p>
    <p>Non-goal: introducing new container/image scanning tool</p>
    <p>To share our findings of real-world container cloud in security aspect To promote discussion and comparison with other production clouds</p>

    <p>Compliance Rules</p>
    <p>Maximum password age must be set to 90 days  Minimum password length must be 8.  Reuse of password must be restricted to eight  Read/write access of ~root/.netrc only by root  Permission setting of /var/log for other must be r-x or more restrictive.  Syslog file permissions must be set: rwx r-x r-x (or more restrictive)  /var/log/faillog must exist for all systems not using pam_tally2.so  rsh server must not be installed  SSH must not be installed  SSH password authentication must be disabled  Password must not be weak</p>

    <p>Why Scanning Live Containers is Critical?</p>
    <p>Image security is only one part of overall container security  Having secure image is great, but</p>
    <p>What if container instance gets directly modified?  Image scanning results become invalid!</p>
    <p>DevOps builds upon the assumption of immutability  Updates should be applied to the source image and the instance should be launched again</p>
    <p>Question  Does security posture change after images instantiate to containers?</p>
    <p>That is, are there any drifts?  If so, what does it look like?</p>

    <p>both</p>
    <p>vulnerability drifts</p>
    <p>compliance drifts</p>
    <p>Drifts do exist and the magnitude is non-negligible.Most vulnerability drifts are due to the change of definition. Site-specific differences exists. Absolute # of drift does not imply higher/lower security level.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Drift Findings - continued</p>

    <p>Vulnerability Drifts Compliance Drifts</p>
    <p>Drifts are not always in the increasing direction. In-place updates does happen in both benign and disruptive ways.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Drift Findings - SSH</p>
    <p>Recall 3 SSH-related compliance rules [9A] SSH server must not be installed [9F] SSH password-based authentication must be</p>
    <p>disabled [9G] Password must not be weak</p>
    <p>No SSH, but password becomes weak 1 1.3% 1 1.2%</p>
    <p>SSH gets installed 31 39.2% 19 23.5%</p>
    <p>SSH gets installed with weak password ID 3 3.8%</p>

    <p>Password becomes strong 3 26.6% 26 32.1%</p>
    <p>Password-based authentication gets disabled 13 16.5% 2 2.5%</p>

    <p>Why Drifts Happen?</p>
    <p>Benign drifts  Newly added definitions of vulnerable packages</p>
    <p>Updated/added compliance rules</p>
    <p>Implementation changes</p>
    <p>Introduction of bugs</p>
    <p>System Anomalies</p>
    <p>Disruptive drifts  Update via Remote access: SSH login or docker exec</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>First look at the security postures of real-world container cloud</p>
    <p>Achieving secure container cloud requires  Automated image scanning</p>
    <p>Vulnerability amplification</p>
    <p>In addition, aggregate analysis needed to determine the true source of vulnerabilities</p>
    <p>Live container scanning  Drifts do exist in the real world: about 5%</p>
    <p>Different type of drifts  Increase/decrease</p>
    <p>Benign/disruptive</p>
    <p>Majority are benign drifts of vulnerable package increase</p>
    <p>But, disruptive manual in-place updates do exist</p>
    <p>could lead to serious problem</p>
    <p>Must be accompanied with static image scanning</p>
