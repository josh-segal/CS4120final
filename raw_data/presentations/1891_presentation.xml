    <p>Overview of Our Approach</p>
    <p>We replace the Product Separation Oracle with a modified version (Purified Separation Oracle) that generates cuts corresponding to pure strategy profiles: given y  0, output (Us)</p>
    <p>T y 1 that is violated at y. Now each constraint of (D) is one of the original constraints of (D).</p>
    <p>any run of ellipsoid method that is valid for (D) is also valid for (D) no longer requiring special mechanism to deal with numerical issues</p>
    <p>A solution of (P) is a mixture of polynomial number of pure-strategy profiles.</p>
    <p>Get vertex by applying a standard algorithm for finding basic feasible solutions given a feasible solution.</p>
