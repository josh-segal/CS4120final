    <p>Online marketplaces: Sites allowing users to buy/sell goods</p>
    <p>Among most successful Web sites E.g., eBay, Overstock, Amazon Marketplace eBay alone: $60B in 2009</p>
    <p>Allows buyers and sellers to connect Regardless of location Enable esoteric products to find a market Democratized commerce</p>
