    <p>Cloud Computing</p>
    <p>New delivery and consumption model for IT  No set up cost for users and on-demand usage  Several service models emerging:</p>
    <p>Infrastructure, Platform, Software.</p>
    <p>Infrastructure-as-a-Service  Easily acquire and release virtual servers, storage, bandwidth  Provider manages the virtual infrastructure resources  User manages the application and OS</p>
    <p>New model = new challenges for service management  Virtualized and abstracted resources  Limited visibility into the infrastructure layer</p>
    <p>self-service</p>
    <p>usage-based pricing</p>
    <p>rapid elasticity on-demand consumption</p>
    <p>location independence</p>
    <p>What is required to support problem determination in the cloud environment</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Problems in the Cloud  Our objective: develop an understanding of the nature of problems</p>
    <p>experienced by customers of an IaaS cloud</p>
    <p>Understand the types of problems arising in deployment and operation  How do these change over time (longitudinal study)</p>
    <p>How users go about solving their problems today  Which problems require more help from cloud providers  Which problems are persistently difficult to solve</p>
    <p>Develop a preliminary characterization of the forum-based cloud support model  See paper for details</p>
    <p>Identify useful mechanisms and best practices for efficient problem resolution in the cloud</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Data-driven Approach  Study actual user problems and experiences</p>
    <p>Based on open support forum of a large IaaS Cloud provider</p>
    <p>3 years of message threads  August 2006 through December 2009  9,575 reported problems (threads)</p>
    <p>Too many for manual classification  Each thread consists of a number of related forum postings</p>
    <p>Free text problem symptoms and suggested solutions  Timestamps and user id  Need to impose structure for automated grouping</p>
    <p>Text analytics to classify reported problems  IR techniques to group problems into clusters  91% of threads mapped to 27 clusters  Grouped in 5 classes</p>

    <p>Evolution of Problem Classes</p>
    <p>Image maintenance shrinks: release of new tools  Improves on existing techniques  E.g 1st Quarter 2007: image manipulation feature</p>
    <p>Virtualization grows: release of new features  Users unfamiliar with new feature  E.g 3st Quarter 2008: virtual storage</p>

    <p>Problem Difficulty</p>
    <p>Users consult operators for difficult problems  Operators involvement needed for 20-65% of the threads  Performance &amp; virtual infrastructure requires the most help</p>
    <p>Performance: virtualization abstracts away details needed to debug  Virtual Infrastructure: user cant change state of providers</p>

    <p>Evolution of Problem Difficulty</p>
    <p>Over time less help is needed from the operators  Forum builds up a DB of solutions</p>
    <p>In a few cases users still need help from the operators  Resource abstraction limits user control/visibility</p>
    <p>The virtual infrastructure class is the exception  New features are added: users need help understanding them</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Observations and Suggestions  Large fraction of problems solved through self-diagnosis</p>
    <p>by users</p>
    <p>Limited user visibility causes more operator involvement  E.g., Difficult to determine root cause of instance unresponsive  Suggestion solution: expose information to the user</p>
    <p>Additional user control for some services could streamline resolution  E.g., inspect or change storage volume state  Suggestion solution: expose additional control to the user</p>
    <p>New features often introduce new problems  Suggestion: Proactive release of companion debugging tools</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Some Issues in Enabling Suggested Solutions</p>
    <p>Expose information to the user  Protect provider infrastructure details  Expose only information relevant to user  Reduce collection/storage overhead</p>
    <p>Expose additional user control  Multitenancy complications  Preventing misuse at the infrastructure level  Making the controls scalable</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Empirical study of problems in large provider  Classified problem reports into 5 main groups  Most persistent problems: virtual infrastructure &amp;</p>
    <p>performance</p>
    <p>Problems become less difficult as the forum builds up a database of solutions</p>
    <p>Suggested mechanisms for more effective resolution  Expose more information  Add user control for infrastructure services  Develop specific debug tools for new releases</p>
