    <p>Gain a better understanding of peoples daily authentication behavior and opinion through interviews and tracking their authentication events to inform future projects that aim at reducing users authentication burden.</p>
    <p>What do people authenticate to, how, when, and where?</p>
    <p>Which authentications are error-prone?</p>

    <p>Authentication event*</p>
    <p>An authentication event is an act where an individual must demonstrate, actively, that the he is the right person to gain access to a resource or service through something he is (or does), something he knows, or something he has.</p>

    <p>Limitations  Under-reporting: Minimized effort to log an event, but cannot rule out under-reporting.</p>
    <p>Small sample size: A convenience sample of 26 participants.</p>
    <p>Self-logged vs. auto-logged: Phone events are auto-logged and rest are self-logged.</p>
    <p>A snapshot of a week: May not be representative of the participants typical week.</p>
    <p>Possible change in participants behavior: Participation in the study could affect participant behavior.</p>
    <p>A couple of Cmes I leD my PC unlocked when I stepped away for just a minute because I didn't want to have to log it&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I found myself typing my passwords slower so I'd get them</p>

    <p>&quot;[Most effort are physical keys] first you have to find it in your purse, then pick out the right key from the ring. [...] So keys were a lot of effort, and the phone unlock wasnt.&quot;</p>

    <p>The creaCvity in me makes them [passwords] more complicated  part of my frustraCon is that. [AuthenCcaCon] Its kind of evil. Its a</p>
    <p>constant reminder that there are bad people.</p>
    <p>I always have to search in my purse for my keys or my badge. Its a giant black hole.</p>
    <p>How do I log this event? I entered my password and my laptop crashed.</p>
    <p>[Locked keys in the car] But a guy in the parking lot was able to break into my car for me. I was never happier in my life to meet a competent criminal.</p>
    <p>Also, I feel embarrassed wearing it [badge ID]  kind of like Im a kid in kindergarten with a name tag. And I hate my photo thats on it.</p>
    <p>I'm also not happy with door key unlocking.</p>
