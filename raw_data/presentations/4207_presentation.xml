    <p>Task: predict whether a social media post, will get many positive and negative responses, or no?</p>
    <p>Yes, controversial</p>
    <p>No, not controversial</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Utility to site moderators and administrators</p>
    <p>Monitoring for bad controversy can prevent harm to the group</p>
    <p>Bringing productive controversy to the communitys attention can help the group solve problems</p>
    <p>Controversy (as we have defined it) is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Observation: controversy is community-specific</p>
    <p>break up: controversial in the Reddit group on relationships, but not in the group for posing questions to women</p>
    <p>my parents: controversial for personal-finance group (example: live with my parents) but not in the relationships group</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Observation: we can also use early reactions</p>
    <p>Early opinions can greatly affect subsequent opinion dynamics (Salganik et al. MusicLab experiment, Science 2006, inter alia)</p>
    <p>Both the content and structure of the early discussion tree may prove helpful.</p>

    <p>Does the shape of the tree predict controversy?</p>
    <p>Usually yes, even after controlling for the rate of incoming comments.</p>
    <p>Tree Features - max depth/total comment ratio - proportion of comments that were top-level</p>
    <p>(i.e., made in direct reply to the original post) - average node depth - average branching factor - proportion of top-level comments replied to - Gini coefficient of replies to top-level comments</p>
    <p>(to measure how clustered the total discussion is) - Wiener Index of virality</p>
    <p>(average pairwise pathlength between all pairs of nodes)</p>
    <p>Rate Features</p>
    <p>- total number of comments - logged time between OP and the first reply - average logged parent-child reply time</p>

    <p>We can use features of the content and structure of the early discussion tree</p>
