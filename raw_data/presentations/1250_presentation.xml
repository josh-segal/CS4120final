    <p>Quantum Circuit Maps Every quantum computers is composed of multiple qubits  each with</p>
    <p>potentially different number of qubits and topological structure</p>
    <p>quantum algorithm. For example, if the estimated error rate of each qubit is significantly different than the actual error rate when the circuit map is executed, then these differences add up over the circuit map execution and result in a significantly inaccurate outcome. Therefore, previous works have focused on estimating the error rates accurately and using that to find the optimal circuit map [3, 15, 18, 25, 26, 28].</p>
    <p>What is Missing from Existing Solutions? Current approaches use a single number to characterize the error rate of a given qubit irrespective of the different quantum operations being performed on the qubit [25, 26, 28, 31]. For the first time, we show that error rate is not only qubit-specific, but also operation-specific (as explained in Sec. 2, a 1-qubit gate can perform different types of quantum operations on a single qubit). We show that quantum error rates can vary significantly depending on the specific quantum operation that is being performed, even if other conditions are kept constant (i.e., the physical qubit and the machine). Some qubits with low aggregate average error rate might experience high error rate for specific quantum operations. Hence, these qubits should be avoided for a circuit-map selection if a particular circuit consists of many such specific quantum operations. The reason for this phenomena is the unstable nature of current NISQ technology where qubits are erroneous and do not have consistent properties as different qubits interact differently with external control and the environmental features. This is the first work to discover and leverage the above insight to choose better circuit maps that lower the impact of quantum errors, and push the state-of-the-art in improving the efficiency of quantum algorithm execution on NISQ computers.</p>

    <p>Background. This study is performed on the IBM Quantum Experience (QX) - a public cloud service. We use the IBM QX machines listed in Table 1. They cover a diverse range of quantum architectures in terms of errorrates, topology, and time of introduction (Fig. 2).</p>
    <p>Quantum operations on these computers include both the gate and readout operations. Primary 1-qubit gates include the Hadamard (H) gate which puts the two basis states into equal superposition and the x-, y-, and zrotation gates (Rx, Ry, and Rz, respectively) which rotate the qubit about the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis on the Bloch Sphere, respectively. The Bloch Sphere is a unit sphere with the |0i state represented as a vector pointing toward the positive z-axis and the |1i state is represented on the negative z-axis. The other two axis represent the qubit phase. The qubit state vector can point anywhere on the Bloch Sphere, but upon readout, it collapses to the positive (|0i) or negative (|1i) z-axis. As an example, Fig. 3 uses the Bloch Sphere to show the state changes after applying a H gate followed by a Rz gate with p rotation to a single qubit. When the H gate is applied, the qubit state vector points toward the positive x-axis and the qubit is equally probable to be measured as |0i or |1i. This probability of measurement remains the same even after a Rz rotation is applied, except the qubit has a negative phase.</p>
    <p>All 1-qubit gates have 2-qubit variants (CH, CRx, CRy and CRz) where one qubit is the control and the other is the target. The respective 1-qubit gate is applied to the target qubit depending on the superposition of the control qubit. In Fig. 1, the connection between qubit 0 and Rz gate of qubit 1 means it is a CRz gate with qubit 0 as control and qubit 1 as target.</p>

Some qubits with low aggregate average error rate might experience high error rate for specific quantum operations. Hence, these qubits should be avoided for a circuit-map selection if a particular circuit consists of many such specific quantum operations. The reason for this phenomena is the unstable nature of current NISQ technology where qubits are erroneous and do not have consistent properties as different qubits interact differently with external control and the environmental features. This is the first work to discover and leverage the above insight to choose better circuit maps that lower the impact of quantum errors, and push the state-of-the-art in improving the efficiency of quantum algorithm execution on NISQ computers.</p>
    <p>UREQA Solution. UREQA1 builds a data driven model for correctly estimating the error rates of operations on different qubits of a quantum computer, and then, leverages this information to find the most optimized circuit for a quantum algorithm. UREQA builds its error rate prediction model by performing a large number of experiments on real IBM NISQ computers. Our evaluation shows that these error rate prediction methods are more accurate than current state-of-the-art approaches of simply using a general error rate number periodically published by the quantum computing platform provider.</p>

    <p>Background. This study is performed on the IBM Quantum Experience (QX) - a public cloud service. We use the IBM QX machines listed in Table 1. They cover a diverse range of quantum architectures in terms of errorrates, topology, and time of introduction (Fig. 2).</p>
    <p>Quantum operations on these computers include both the gate and readout operations. Primary 1-qubit gates include the Hadamard (H) gate which puts the two basis states into equal superposition and the x-, y-, and zrotation gates (Rx, Ry, and Rz, respectively) which rotate the qubit about the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis on the Bloch Sphere, respectively. The Bloch Sphere is a unit sphere with the |0i state represented as a vector pointing toward the positive z-axis and the |1i state is represented on the negative z-axis. The other two axis represent the qubit phase. The qubit state vector can point anywhere on the Bloch Sphere, but upon readout, it collapses to the positive (|0i) or negative (|1i) z-axis. As an example, Fig. 3 uses the Bloch Sphere to show the state changes after applying a H gate followed by a Rz gate with p rotation to a single qubit. When the H gate is applied, the qubit state vector points toward the positive x-axis and the qubit is equally probable to be measured as |0i or |1i. This probability of measurement remains the same even after a Rz rotation is applied, except the qubit has a negative phase.</p>
    <p>All 1-qubit gates have 2-qubit variants (CH, CRx, CRy and CRz) where one qubit is the control and the other is the target. The respective 1-qubit gate is applied to the target qubit depending on the superposition of the control qubit. In Fig. 1, the connection between qubit 0 and Rz gate of qubit 1 means it is a CRz gate with qubit 0 as control and qubit 1 as target.</p>

    <p>based on Josephson Junctions, and the Transmon frequency is referred to as the qubit frequency. On IBMs quantum computers, the qubits are implemented using Josephson Junctions created by separated superconducting electrodes and capacitors as shown in Fig. 4. 1qubit gates are performed by applying external controls in the form of microwave pulses. Errors in applying these pulses cause 1-qubit gate errors. Entanglement between two qubits is performed using coupling resonators. These coupling resonators can be highly erroneous causing 2-qubit gate errors. Lastly, readout operation (or qubit state measurement) is performed using readout resonators as shown in Fig. 4. The readout resonators are also highly error-prone and cause readout errors when qubit states are measured. In fact, other factors can also affect error rates. Once initialized, a qubit can only retain its state for a limited time (coherence time). There are two types of coherence times: (1) The T1 coherence time is associated with amplitude damping due to the qubits natural energy decay to the ground state. (2) The T2 coherence time is associated with phase damping due to environmental factors.</p>
    <p>IBMs computers are calibrated twice a day, and the qubit coherence times change after each calibration. We note that the error rates are determined when calibration tasks are performed for all the operations of a quantum computer. Calibration is the task of determining qubit frequency and accordingly, setting the properties of the microwave tone which changes the state of a qubit. During calibration, operation characteristics such as the frequency of a qubit and the optimal microwave tone amplitude are determined based on new properties of the qubit. These characteristics are then used to perform all the operations. These new characteristics determine the error rate of the operation. The effect of environmental factors (such as the electromagnetic interference, fluctu</p>

Note that regular circuits (jobs) cannot run on machines when calibration is being performed. Thus, it is impractical to constantly keep calibrating the machines, and hence, this practical constraint forces the calibration to be performed typically twice daily.</p>
    <p>Current Efforts in Circuit Mapping. IBM posts a single error number for all 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates for each qubit twice a day. One solution to the aforementioned circuit mapping problem can be to map quantum operations on qubits which have the minimum operation error rates according to these posted numbers [10, 25, 26, 28]. The idea is to maximize the Estimated Success Probability (ESP) of a quantum circuit [25]. The ESP is calculated as</p>
    <p>Ngates i=1 gi</p>
    <p>Nreadout j=1 m j , where g is the success</p>
    <p>rate of gates and m is the success rate of readout (success rate = 1 - error rate). The circuit map with highest ESP is the optimal circuit map. Fig. 5 shows the impact of choosing a low quality circuit map vs. an optimal circuit map for executing the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm. The correct output of QPE has states |100i, |101i, and |111i with probability 0.125, and state |110i with probability 0.625. On real-systems, executing a circuit map results in state probabilities that are different than the correct probabilities. Using the correct probabilities as reference, the optimal circuit map has an overall error of 6% (sum of errors of all states divided by 2), while the low quality circuit has an overall error of 28%. Thus, estimating the ESP of a circuit map accurately (and hence, in turn estimating the error rate of quantum operations) is critical for mitigating the sideeffects of erroneous quantum operations. However, current approach of using the published numbers to estimate the error rates implicitly assumes that all 1-qubit operations have uniform errors and that all 2-qubit operations also have uniform errors. This is far from the actual behavior of errors as we show next.</p>
    <p>Different quantum operations exhibit significant</p>
    <p>variation in observed error rates. Fig.6 shows that quantum errors are correlated with the specific type of operation being performed (on the same qubit; results are averaged over all available qubits and platforms for simplicity). For example, on IBM computers Rz is imple</p>
