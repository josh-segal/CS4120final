    <p>Something we know</p>
    <p>Data centers are energy hogs</p>
    <p>Combined energy usage of all data centers would rank 5th in the world if data centers were a country</p>
    <p>Tens of millions of in annual operational costs</p>
    <p>Responsible for 2% electricity usage and 1% greenhouse gas emissions</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Something we may not know</p>
    <p>Data centers are very thirsty</p>
    <p>2013 Uptime Institute survey shows that a majority of large data centers use cooling towers to remove heat from server rooms to the environment</p>
    <p>AT&amp;Ts data center facilities consume 1 billion gallons of water in 2012</p>
    <p>Taking up 30% of the entire companys water consumption</p>

    <p>Google is drinking water</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Something we may not know</p>
    <p>Data centers also consume water remotely</p>
    <p>Electricity production consumes water</p>
    <p>The #1 water withdrawal among all sectors</p>
    <p>U.S. national average 1.8 L/kWh, excluding hydropower</p>
    <p>Data centers account for approx. 1% water withdrawal in the U.S.</p>
    <p>Data centers consume 1.72.3% electricity</p>
    <p>Electricity accounts for 40+% water withdrawal</p>

    <p>Why should we care about water?</p>
    <p>Extended droughts are becoming a norm</p>

    <p>Why should we care about water?</p>
    <p>Extended droughts are becoming a norm</p>
    <p>California declared state-wide drought emergency on Jan. 17, 2014, urging all residents and businesses to cut back water usage by 20%</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What if drought is far away?</p>
    <p>Water conservation gets you</p>
    <p>Green certifications (e.g., LEED program)</p>
    <p>Water reduction is a prerequisite</p>
    <p>Tightening water compliance codes</p>
    <p>U.S. government mandates 2% water efficiency improvement for federal facilities each year through 2020</p>

    <p>Industry has realized the water issue</p>
    <p>Google uses recycled water/seawater in some of its facilities</p>
    <p>Facebook uses air economizer (a.k.a. free cooling)  Recently released source code for monitoring</p>
    <p>water usage</p>
    <p>In 2013, LBNL recommends water and energy as two key considerations for U.S. federal data center consolidation</p>

    <p>Limitations of existing approaches</p>
    <p>The existing approaches primarily focus on improved engineering</p>
    <p>High upfront capital costs</p>
    <p>Suitable climate/locations</p>
    <p>Offsite water is not explicitly addressed</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Water is equal to energy?  Not really</p>
    <p>Water efficiency changes over time</p>
    <p>Just like minimizing electricity cost with time-varying electricity prices, we need to consider when to consume energy</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Time-varying (offsite) water efficiency</p>
    <p>Energy fuel mix changes over time for electricity  Different energy fuel types have different water efficiencies</p>

    <p>How can we exploit time diversity of water efficiency?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>We propose</p>
    <p>We can turn off some servers and defer some delaytolerant workloads to time periods that are more water-efficient  But how to determine if a time period is efficient?</p>
    <p>We also need to consider electricity cost (and carbon footprint if applicable)</p>
    <p>WACE: opportunistically schedule batch jobs  First, queue up the job arrivals</p>
    <p>If the queue length is too large and/or water efficiency is already good, then process waiting jobs</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>How does WACE work?</p>
    <p>Input:</p>
    <p>Online information: WUE, electricity price, etc.</p>
    <p>Solve online optimization:</p>
    <p>Minimize V             : weighted sum of water footprint, electricity cost and carbon</p>
    <p>footprint</p>
    <p>: batch job queue length</p>
    <p>: processed batch jobs</p>
    <p>Update batch job queue length</p>
    <p>Provably-efficient while bounding queue length</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Case study</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>How to evaluate WACE?</p>
    <p>Lets consider a real-life trace simulation</p>
    <p>MSR workload; data center in Mountain View, California</p>
    <p>Benchmarks</p>
    <p>SAVING: Optimize for electricity cost</p>
    <p>CARBON: Optimize for carbon footprint</p>
    <p>ALWAYS: Optimize for delay performance</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Big water saving at (a small) delay increase</p>
    <p>WACE reduces water footprint</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>WACE reduces the total cost without increasing delay</p>
    <p>Minimizing electricity cost or carbon emission is not sufficient for minimizing water footprint!</p>
    <p>WACE reduces total cost</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Three messages</p>
    <p>Data centers are thirsty</p>
    <p>Water footprint != energy or electricity cost or carbon emission</p>
    <p>Time diversity of water efficiency can be exploited for reducing water footprint</p>
