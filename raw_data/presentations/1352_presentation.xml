    <p>Conclusions Highlights</p>
    <p>Researchers have little incentive to follow the rules</p>
    <p>IRBs are often unequipped to perform their duties</p>
    <p>Collaboration needed between ethics boards,</p>
    <p>researchers</p>

    <p>Study Goals</p>
    <p>Original Motivation:</p>
    <p>Homophily in web browsing</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>Wisdom of crowds in phishing detection</p>
    <p>Is this site new? To your friends?</p>
    <p>Results:</p>
    <p>With 10 friends, 99% of clicks to previously visited sites</p>
    <p>95% of web sites are previously visited</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Technical Implementation</p>
    <p>Where: Campus dormitory</p>
    <p>Collection Point: Dedicated FreeBSD server</p>
    <p>Data Collection:</p>
    <p>Mirror packets destined for TCP port 80 with Berkeley</p>
    <p>packet filter</p>
    <p>No content fetched, no HTTPS traffic observed</p>
    <p>Session information removed from URL when found</p>
    <p>Automated requests removed when found</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Overview: Data Set  Timeframe: March 5, 2008 through May 3, 2008</p>
    <p>What: HTTP GET requests to TCP port 80,</p>
    <p>URL requested*, referring URL*,</p>
    <p>identity of the user agent* (* - filtered)</p>
    <p>Recorded:</p>
    <p>408 million HTTP requests</p>
    <p>1,083 unique MAC addresses</p>
    <p>29.8 million page requests from 967 unique users</p>
    <p>630,000 distinct Web servers</p>
    <p>110,000 distinct servers provided referrers</p>

    <p>Study Details: After</p>
    <p>This Paper:</p>
    <p>Release instruments &amp; note difficulties</p>
    <p>Aid other researchers &amp; improve dialog</p>
    <p>Discuss human-subjects protocols &amp; study</p>
    <p>design</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Meiss et al, HyperText 2009</p>
    <p>Additional Research Use:</p>
    <p>There is no typical http session</p>
    <p>The concept of session can mislead researchers</p>
    <p>Pure networking</p>
    <p>No approval or review process</p>
    <p>Governing Frameworks Matter!</p>
    <p>Administrative bodies must be involved</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>IRB Interactions</p>
    <p>Original Language:</p>
    <p>Non-public browser requests (sites that use</p>
    <p>encryption such as your email, financial</p>
    <p>institutions, academic records, and Oncourse) will</p>
    <p>not be viewed or recorded in this experiment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>IRB Interactions</p>
    <p>Final Language:</p>
    <p>Any web traffic that is encrypted  i.e., traffic that is</p>
    <p>sent via https:// or through a VPN connection</p>
    <p>cannot be captured or recorded as part of this study.</p>
    <p>So if you decide you dont want any of your web</p>
    <p>browsing information to be recorded as part of this</p>
    <p>study, you can encrypt your web traffic in one of two</p>
    <p>ways:  Ensure that the website you are using has a URL starting with https://</p>
    <p>instead of http://</p>
    <p>Use IUs Virtual Private Network (VPN) service: [link removed]</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Successes With Ethical Design</p>
    <p>Data Minimization:</p>
    <p>User data was de-identified as it was captured</p>
    <p>Session data removed from URLs when identified</p>
    <p>All URL data was de-identified before data was processed</p>
    <p>Discussion With Stakeholders</p>
    <p>Opt-out Increased Security</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Ethical Design Failures</p>
    <p>Opt-out vs. Opt-in</p>
    <p>Gauging Student Understanding</p>
    <p>Student Government vs. IRB / HSC</p>
    <p>Additional Use of Data</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Tension Between Security, Privacy and Trust</p>
    <p>Poorly-written Anonymization Service:</p>
    <p>Attempting to obscure traffic to an adult chat site</p>
    <p>Spoofing requests from uninvolved clients</p>
    <p>Name of site communicated sexual orientation</p>
    <p>Our Options:</p>
    <p>notify individual &amp; direct them to better resources</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Our Decision: Do Nothing</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>Individual identification too problematic</p>
    <p>Social loss of privacy vs. technical increase in</p>
    <p>privacy</p>
    <p>Identification could cause harm!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Other Situations</p>
    <p>Criminal Activity?</p>
    <p>Child endangerment</p>
    <p>and abuse must be</p>
    <p>reported</p>
    <p>No other case merits</p>
