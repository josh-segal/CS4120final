    <p>Many existing congestion control protocols , such as XCP, RCP, MaxNet, MKC, VCP, and JetMax, are max-min methods</p>
    <p>In max-min congestion control, each user i calculates its sending rate xi(n) based on feedback pi(n) generated by the most-congested link</p>
    <p>Network feedback is subject to delays, which are not only heterogeneous but also directional</p>

    <p>It is proved by Zhang et al. (SIGCOMM04) system (+) is stable if A is symmetric and (A)&lt;1</p>
    <p>However, this result is very restrictive</p>
    <p>Utilizing induced matrix norms, we can obtain an alternative proof of this result and have the following observation</p>
    <p>Corollary 1: System (+) is stable for all delays Di if</p>
    <p>Clearly, this condition is tighter (i.e., less restrictive) than the previous result</p>

    <p>In this paper, we studied stability of max-min congestion control systems under diagonal delays</p>
    <p>Our results improved the understanding of delayindependent stability from the requirement that (A) &lt;1 and A is symmetric to the simple condition that ||A||s&lt;1</p>
    <p>Simulations suggest that ||A||s&lt;1 is also a necessary condition</p>
    <p>The obtained results are of broader interest and apply to any system that can be modeled by (+) or (*)</p>
