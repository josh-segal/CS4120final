    <p>Introduction  Experiences from United States Military</p>
    <p>Academys CS482 Information Assurance  Senior undergraduates in CS, IT and EE</p>
    <p>Imperatives  Provide graduates with knowledge of, and</p>
    <p>appreciation for, information system security  What do I wish MY undergraduate program</p>
    <p>provided?</p>
    <p>Theory and practice: classroom instruction and competitive security exercises</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Classroom Instruction  There is no substitute for hands-on learning,</p>
    <p>especially in security  Alternating lectures and practical exercises, plus</p>
    <p>labs  Active, self-guided learning</p>
    <p>STFW and RTFM  Google is your fiend friend</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Capture the Flag Scrimmage  Head-to-head competition between groups</p>
    <p>Objective: gather others flags while protecting your own  Combination of offense and defense  Free form; loose rules of engagement</p>
    <p>Deliverables  Action plans  Flags found  After action reviews</p>
    <p>Observations  Teamwork and a good plan carried the day  First contact with exercise conditions was an eye-opener  Several students showed a visible increase in enthusiasm</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>NSA/CSS Cyber Defense Exercise (CDX)</p>
    <p>Annual, week-long exercise  Students design, implement and defend a Blue</p>
    <p>Cell network  NSA provides a headquarters White Cell and</p>
    <p>attacking Red Cell  Scoring is based on preserving confidentiality,</p>
    <p>integrity and availability, plus accomplishing injected security tasks</p>
    <p>CDX serves as our capstone exercise</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Updated Features in CDX 2010</p>
    <p>More realistic representation of client side threats</p>
    <p>Administrator hands-off  No process whack-a-mole  Penalty for user disruption</p>
    <p>Patch freeze  Virtual 0-days</p>
    <p>Tainted hosts  Live user Grey Cell  Acceptable use policies</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>CDX Preparation Phase</p>
    <p>Students design a network conforming to a network specification and a notional budget  Services: web, e-mail, DNS/AD, chat, file server, VoIP, PKI  Safeguards and infrastructure  Defensible network architecture  COA development</p>
    <p>Students implement their network from bare metal and installation media</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>CDX Live Phase  Week-long, 0700  2200 daily  Red Cell operates full time</p>
    <p>Flooding DOS and on-site attacks are out of scope  Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities only  Limited social engineering</p>
    <p>Incident response  Reporting  Injects, e.g.</p>
    <p>Forensic analysis  Technical orders  Web crawler  Generals laptop</p>

    <p>Lessons Learned</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The value of competition</p>
    <p>Competitions capture the imagination  We see greater effort than for grades alone  Team working</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Security makes the other stuff more interesting</p>
    <p>Security can serve as a lure that builds interest otherwise boring material</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>They dont know what they dont know  It is easy to underestimate the inexperience of</p>
    <p>undergraduates  Assignments can guide students to producing</p>
    <p>deliverables they dont know that they need</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>It takes longer than they think it will  Time estimation is hard, especially for</p>
    <p>undergraduates  Written estimates and back briefings  Annual CDX death march  not entirely bad</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Students often miss the obvious, but learn from doing so</p>
    <p>Sometimes the easy way really IS the easy way  After action reviews are essential for learning</p>
    <p>from missing the obvious</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The value of preparation  Preparation usually trumps inspired improvisation  Have a plan.and a backupor two</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Replicating the client side is hard, but important</p>
    <p>The client side is as important as the server side  Replicating users is difficult but necessary to</p>
    <p>replicate current threats</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Security courses are among the most time consuming and resource intensive</p>
    <p>Some subject areas need little updating  Security principles may change little, but practical</p>
    <p>details change constantly  New technology, protocols, software  Threats, exploits and vulnerabilities; new and obsolete  Virtualization is a key labor saver</p>
    <p>Competitive exercises require even more effort, but are worthwhile</p>
