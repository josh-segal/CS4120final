    <p>Sentence Labeling</p>
    <p>Comparative sentence (CS) A sentence which indirectly express an opinion by performing a comparison between two products</p>
    <p>Rules to identify general CS KW: 126 keywords (outperform, exceed) POS tags (JJR, RBR, JJS, RBS) Predefined patterns (as &lt;word&gt; as)</p>
    <p>Refine CS A sentence contains one or more than one different product names</p>

    <p>Sentence Labeling</p>
    <p>Subjective sentence (SS) A sentence expressing directed praise or deprecation about a product</p>
    <p>Rules to identify SS If a sentence contains subjective words (positive, negative), it is classified to be a subjective sentence</p>

    <p>Sentiment Identification  Use the keyword strategy</p>
    <p>{MPQA[1] + our own words  1974 positive words + 4605 negative words + 28 negation words} Positive subjective sentences (PS) Negative subjective sentences (NS) Positive comparative sentences (PC) Negative comparative sentences (NC)</p>
    <p>Positive Subjective(PS)  This camera has great picture quality and conveniently priced.</p>
    <p>Negative Subjective(NS)  The picture quality of this camera is really bad.</p>
    <p>Positive Comparative(PC)  This camera has superior shutter speed when compared to the Nikon P40.</p>
    <p>Negative Comparative(NC)  This is the worst camera I have seen so far.</p>

    <p>G = { V, E }  V is the set of vertices. Each vertex represents</p>
    <p>a product  E is the set of edges. The edge weight</p>
    <p>represents the comparative relationship between products</p>
    <p>Weight of a node is determined by the number of positive/negative subjective sentences (PS/NS)</p>
    <p>ex. A has excellent picture quality  Weight of an edge is determined by the</p>
    <p>number of positive and negative comparative sentences</p>
    <p>ex. B is better than C. B is worse than C</p>
