    <p>Vary readability of the question text  Low readability  complex sentences  High readability  simple sentences  Low-achieving students perform better on MWPs with simple</p>
    <p>sentences than MWPs with complex sentences  Wheeler and McNutt (1983)</p>
    <p>Sentence complexity is related to sentence length  Sentence length affects readability (Coleman, 1962)  Sentence length is a component of readability formulae (Flesch, 1949)  One means of minimising sentence length is to switch off refactoring</p>
    <p>and aggregation in the NLG system (but text is longer!)</p>

    <p>Vary mathematical difficulty</p>
    <p>Vary the type of problem  In basic maths classes, concepts are taught in order of increasing</p>
    <p>difficulty. E.g., addition of single-digit numbers is taught before percentages</p>
    <p>Vary the difficulty on a scale by consulting a maths curriculum  U.K. Qualification and Curriculum Authority (1999)  Corpus study of precision and mathematical form in discourse (Williams and</p>
    <p>Power, 2009)</p>
    <p>Vary the order of presentation of numerical values  There is a natural order of values for some calculations. E.g., 2:3 for a</p>
    <p>ratio but 3-2 for a subtraction (if +ve answer required)  Reversing the natural order increases difficulty  Students rearranged values to the natural order when asked to modify</p>

    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>Automatic generation of MWPs is a potential solution for the ITS question bottleneck</p>
    <p>The Semantic Web provides a potential solution to the NLG data source bottleneck</p>
    <p>MWPs are an interesting research area  Prototype system for generating MWPs implemented and</p>
    <p>walk-through presented  System is still to be tested with an ITS system and with users.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Other factors that influence MWP difficulty</p>
    <p>Authenticity (Palm, 2009)  Is the purpose of MWPs to teach students to apply abstract</p>
    <p>mathematical principles to real world problems?  If so, some MWPs are unrealistic:</p>
    <p>170 seconds is not a realistic answer (Verschaffel, Greer and Corte, 2000)</p>
    <p>Modelling the real world requires more complex maths  How can we filter out unrealistic MWPs?</p>
    <p>Not a problem with prototype question type</p>
    <p>Johns best time to run 100 meters is 17 seconds. How long will it take him to run 1 kilometer?</p>
