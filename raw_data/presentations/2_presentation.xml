    <p>Motivation: Napster System (May 1999  July 2001)</p>
    <p>Dominant strategy for non-altruistic agents to share nothing and download as much as possible</p>
    <p>free-rider problem study of Gnutella: 70% of users shared nothing</p>
    <p>Why does anyone share? client requires users to opt out of sharing service free, fosters sense of community</p>
    <p>Why isnt this enough? advent of for-profit systems service with more shared files is more competitive</p>

    <p>Outline Unlike talk on Monday, no discussion of fair exchange, escrow, watermarking issues Model:</p>
    <p>a very simple game-theoretic model of a P2P file sharing system, free-rider problem</p>
    <p>Theory: pros and cons of three payment schemes that give rise to strict equilibria in which free-riding does not occur</p>
    <p>Experiments: robust convergence to the same equilibria in an enriched model; also some interesting behaviors</p>

    <p>Model Single-shot game in which agents choose a level of sharing, level of downloading Utility depends on:</p>
    <p>amount downloaded variety of the network disk space used bandwidth used altruism financial transfer</p>

    <p>Micro-Payments Scheme:</p>
    <p>charge users for downloads, reward them for uploads overall, the system breaks even</p>
    <p>Advantage: unique, strict equilibrium for all agents to both share and download maximally</p>
    <p>Disadvantages: equilibrium doesnt hold for risk-averse agents: they dont directly control their number of uploads users can make a profit users dislike micro-payments</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>October 17, 2001 EC'01 6</p>
    <p>Quantized Micro-Payments Scheme:</p>
    <p>charge a fixed price for each block of b files reward uploads as before</p>
    <p>Advantages: may be preferable to users unique, strict equilibrium as before</p>
    <p>Disadvantage: collusion: agents can direct their zero-marginalcost downloads to others</p>

    <p>Points, Rewarding Sharing Scheme:</p>
    <p>points currency: points can be bought but not sold pay agents for size of material shared</p>
    <p>Advantage: no agent makes a profit maximal sharing, downloading is a strict equilibrium</p>
    <p>Disadvantages: no sharing, maximal downloading is also strict equilibrium agents dont want their shared files to be downloaded</p>
    <p>share at off-peak times, share unpopular files</p>
    <p>agent could stop sharing as soon as a file is requested</p>

    <p>Experimental Results Experiments using TD Q-learning Validate and enrich our theoretical model:</p>
    <p>levels of risk-aversion utility functions different types of files and agents</p>
    <p>Experiments: strategy convergence in this richer setting interesting effects</p>
