    <p>Scenario: Distributed storage for multimedia</p>
    <p>all university lecture videos</p>
    <p>Objects large: expensive to provide service for all objects all the time</p>
    <p>services: replication for availability/reliability, placement for performance, long term security, ....</p>
    <p>Observation: not all objects are equally important</p>
    <p>Proposed Approach: Applications annotate temporal object importance</p>
    <p>Storage lowers service for less important object</p>
    <p>Distributed storage</p>

    <p>Managing object persistence Current approaches:</p>
    <p>require manual reclamation or</p>
    <p>continual addition of new storage</p>
    <p>Proposed:</p>
    <p>Annotate temporal object importance</p>
    <p>Storage evicts less important objects to store more important objects</p>
    <p>Challenges:</p>
    <p>Annotations - simple, intuitive and implementable</p>
    <p>Storage helps by providing snapshot of current state</p>
    <p>Distributed storage</p>
