    <p>Issues from Takoma Park 2009</p>
    <p>Many voters did not write down codenumbers</p>
    <p>Some voters found it difficult to read the codenumbers and write them down</p>
    <p>Some voters did not known they needed to write down codenumbers to verify on-line</p>
    <p>Scanner was not HAVA compliant</p>
    <p>Print audit added cost and complexity</p>
    <p>We address these issues</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Image Duplicator</p>
    <p>Separate optional station</p>
    <p>Copies bubble contents</p>
    <p>For each race, orders bubbles by decreasing pixel intensity</p>
    <p>Stateless design</p>
    <p>Reads on-line verification number and markable positions from 2D barcode (and senses alignment marks)</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Mark-Sense Translator</p>
    <p>Connected to PCOS scanner, which detects marked positions</p>
    <p>Stateful design: prints codes from marked positions and privileged information</p>
    <p>Reads encrypted codes from 2D barcode (key bound to TPM)</p>
    <p>Ballot locked under glass while voter checks receipt</p>

    <p>Scantegrity III Casting Station</p>
    <p>Embellished mark sense translator</p>
    <p>New ballot format</p>
    <p>Two different receipt types (type chosen in a verifiably random way)</p>
    <p>Eliminates need for print audits</p>
    <p>Highlights over/under votes (and more) with LED backlighting</p>

    <p>Verifiable Randomness</p>
    <p>Random</p>
    <p>Unpredictable</p>
    <p>Voter can verify that proper procedure was followed (but voter doesnt influence)</p>
    <p>Bits become part of public audit record</p>
    <p>Ex: Camera observes roll of red/green die in clear dome</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Eliminating Print Audits</p>
    <p>In Scantegrity II, print audit is destructive: audited ballot cannot be cast</p>
    <p>In Scantegrity III, indirection permits auditing of cast ballots</p>
    <p>Receipt type I catches misprinting of S1 codes (after release of raceS1 commitment)</p>
    <p>Receipt type II catches misprinting of S2 codes (after release of S1S2 commitment)</p>

    <p>Bolstering Designs with TPM</p>
    <p>End-to-End integrity is not End-to-End security</p>
    <p>Protect privacy, enforce election policy, detect problems sooner</p>
    <p>TPMs help ensure correct software is booted, provide place to store keys &amp; codes, offer monotonic counters</p>
    <p>Election integrity does not depend on TPM</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Discussion</p>
    <p>Image duplicator</p>
    <p>Simple, stateless, low marginal risk</p>
    <p>Separate station; no guarantee same ballot is cast</p>
    <p>Mark sense translator</p>
    <p>More complex mechanism, TPM learns codes</p>
    <p>Scantegrity III casting station</p>
    <p>Eliminates print audit; backlights ballot</p>
    <p>More complex ballot and checking at station</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Security Advantages</p>
    <p>More voters will likely verify votes on-line if receipts are easier to produce</p>
    <p>Copies of all receipts could be made publicly available</p>
    <p>Improves usability and accessibility</p>
    <p>Can detect if extra marks are added after scanning (for stateful designs)</p>
    <p>Failsafe mode of operation is Scantegrity II</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Potential Threats: Malicious Receipt Printers</p>
    <p>Leak codes</p>
    <p>Privacy loss; facilitates bogus claims of malfeasance</p>
    <p>Produce invalid signatures; authenticate false receipt; malfunction</p>
    <p>Disruption; discreditation</p>
    <p>Similar to threats from malicious scanners.</p>
    <p>Cannot violate integrity without detection: voter can compare receipt with ballot; voter can still make hand-written receipt.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Eliminating Invisible Ink</p>
    <p>With mark sense translator, could late-bind codes by printing codes for first time on receipt (requires trust in TPM)</p>
    <p>Reduces complexity caused by invisible ink</p>
    <p>Failsafe mode of operation becomes Scantegrity I, if technology fails</p>
    <p>Improves accessibility (e.g., blind voters can hear codes)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Open Problems</p>
    <p>Implement and test</p>
    <p>How well will human voters respond to designs?</p>
    <p>Improve accessibility</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Improvements to Scantegrity:</p>
    <p>Print trustworthy receipts automatically</p>
    <p>Eliminate print audit</p>
    <p>New back-lighted interface for opscan</p>
    <p>Three receipt printer designs</p>
    <p>Simple stateless image duplicator introduces fewest potential additional security vulnerabilities</p>
    <p>Which is best depends on situation</p>
