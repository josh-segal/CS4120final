    <p>Statistical Machine Learning Makes Automatic Control Practical for Internet Datacenters</p>
    <p>Peter Bodk, Rean Griffith, Charles Sutton Armando Fox, Michael Jordan, David Patterson</p>
    <p>RAD Lab, UC Berkeley</p>
    <p>Goal: optimal resource allocation</p>
    <p>Accurate, optimal resource allocation for web apps  monetary incentive for the cloud user  but cant violate performance SLA  EC2 offers auto-scaling, but only reactive</p>
    <p>e.g.: add more machines if CPU utilization &gt; 70%</p>
    <p>Previous work: simple performance models trained offline  linear or simple queuing models  dont adapt to changes in application performance  inaccurate model implies inaccurate control</p>
    <p>Approach  use statistical methods for accurate modeling and control</p>
    <p>Statistical methods for modeling and control</p>
    <p>Accurate performance model  model end-to-end application latency and its variance</p>
    <p>based on production data  [ACDC 09] Active Exploration of Application Performance Regimes</p>
    <p>Adapting to changes in application performance  slowly adapt model to gradual changes  detect abrupt changes in performance using change-point detection</p>
    <p>retrain model from scratch</p>
    <p>Control policy simulator  use simulator to evaluate different control policies</p>
    <p>simulate application performance using its model  find control parameters that optimize particular cost function 3</p>
    <p>Effect of different hysteresis gains: EC2 experiments vs. simulation</p>
    <p>optimal beta = 0.01 (simulation and experiments)</p>
