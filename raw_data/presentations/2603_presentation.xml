    <p>In December 1984 a UK farmer called a veterinary surgeon to look at a cow that was behaving unusually. Seven weeks later the cow died. Early in 1985 more cows from the same herd developed similar clinical signs. In November 1986 bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE) was first identified as a new disease, later reported in the veterinary press as a novel progressive spongiform encephalopathy. Later still the causal agent of BSE was recognized as an abnormal prion protein. Since the outset the story of BSE has been beset by problems.</p>
