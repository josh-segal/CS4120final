    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>The Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) is the standard for consistent cross-computer document rendering</p>
    <p>PDF documents cannot be edited with commonly accessible tools (MS Word, Adobe Reader, etc.)</p>
    <p>This confers a sense of integrity to the document for the end user</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>There is a disconnect between the content of a PDF and what is actually displayed</p>
    <p>A computer and a human see two different things</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Within this disconnect we can perform a content masking attack which compromises the content integrity of PDF files</p>
    <p>Three information-based online systems rely on the integrity of PDF documents:  Automatic reviewer assignment systems for academic papers</p>
    <p>Plagiarism detection systems  Search engines</p>

    <p>Background Information</p>
    <p>What do these services have in common?  They support PDF submission  They scrape the text out of submitted PDF files to perform their function, rather than using Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</p>
    <p>Text scraping copies the plaintext out of all strings within the PDF file</p>
    <p>Ignores font associated with text</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Background Information</p>
    <p>Automatic conference reviewer assignment systems  Use topic matching to assign reviewers to submitted papers</p>
    <p>Compare frequent words appearing in reviewers published papers to frequent words appearing in submitted papers</p>
    <p>INFOCOM uses Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Background Information</p>
    <p>Plagiarism detection systems  Measure similarity between strings within subject document and all other documents submitted thus far</p>
    <p>Document indexing  Search engines return documents based on the similarity of their content to the search string</p>

    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Automatic Conference Reviewer Assignment Systems</p>
    <p>An author can target a specific reviewer by replacing enough key words in the paper with key words from the reviewers papers</p>
    <p>Key words  uncommon words that appear most frequently</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Automatic Conference Reviewer Assignment Systems</p>
    <p>Algorithm:  Order key words in subject paper and target reviewers corpus by descending frequency</p>
    <p>Construct a word mapping between these two lists</p>
    <p>Create a character mapping between the letters of each pair of words</p>

    <p>Experiment:  We have reproduced the INFOCOM automatic reviewer assignment system</p>
    <p>This includes 114 TPC members from a wellknown security conference and 2094 of their recently published papers for training</p>
    <p>100 additional papers used as testing data</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Plagiarism Detection</p>
    <p>A cheating student can evade a plagiarism detector by replacing the underlying text with gibberish</p>
    <p>Use a scrambling font to render the gibberish as legible (plagiarized) text</p>
    <p>Results in zero similarity with existing work</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Plagiarism Detection</p>
    <p>Zero similarity is unrealistic due to common phrases in language</p>
    <p>We evaluate three methods to target a specific similarity score</p>
    <p>Each method chooses what text to scramble and what text to leave unaltered</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Plagiarism Detection</p>
    <p>By letter  Use scrambling font which scrambles all characters</p>
    <p>Remove characters from being scrambled by order of their frequency of appearance in the language</p>
    <p>Continue removing characters until a target similarity score is reached</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Plagiarism Detection</p>
    <p>By word, in frequency of appearance  Use scrambling font which scrambles all characters</p>
    <p>Order distinct words by frequency of appearance  Apply scrambling font to all words  Remove scrambling font from distinct words until a target similarity score is reached</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Plagiarism Detection</p>
    <p>By word, at random  Use scrambling font which scrambles all characters</p>
    <p>Iterate over document, applying scrambling font at random according to chosen probability</p>
    <p>Modify probability until a target similarity score is reached</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Plagiarism Detection</p>
    <p>Experiment:  Apply scrambling fonts to 10 published papers and target 5-15% similarity score measured by Turnitin</p>

    <p>Content Masking Defense  Conclusion</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Document Indexing</p>
    <p>An attacker can place spam or illicit content in PDF documents indexed by search engines</p>
    <p>These PDFs can show ads instead of legitimate content that users search for</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Document Indexing</p>
    <p>This can be considered a special case of the reviewer assignment system subversion method</p>
    <p>Instead of masking particular words, we are masking the entire document</p>
    <p>Not constrained by spaces however</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Document Indexing</p>
    <p>The larger number of masked characters requires more masking fonts</p>
    <p>Instead of generating fonts ad hoc, we make one font for each glyph</p>
    <p>~84 fonts  Allows for easy automated generation of masked documents</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Attack Against Document Indexing</p>
    <p>Experiment  Used 5 well-known published papers  Masked each as gibberish</p>

    <p>Content Masking Defense  Conclusion</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Defense</p>
    <p>One feasible defense: perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the document to check the integrity of each character.</p>
    <p>Problem:  High computational overhead  High false positive rate</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Content Masking Defense  Our proposal</p>
    <p>Render each character in the fonts embedded in the subject PDF file and perform OCR on those character codes rather than the rendered PDF file itself.</p>
    <p>Save processing time</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges and Technical Details</p>
    <p>Challenge 1: Whole font file is embedded  Contain 2&quot;# = 65,536 characters maximum  Cause high computational overhead</p>
    <p>Solution: Scan the document to extract the characters used, and perform OCR on the series of character used in each font.</p>
  </div>

    <p>Challenges and Technical Details</p>
    <p>Challenge 2: Special characters</p>
    <p>p Unicode: 0xfe</p>
    <p>Unicode: 0x70</p>
    <p>OCR</p>
    <p>Unicode mismatch</p>
    <p>False alarm</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges and Technical Details</p>
    <p>Solution: Font Training 1. Perform OCR on the font and list all similar</p>
    <p>characters. 2. If the detected glyph is in the similar character</p>
    <p>list, replace the characters Unicode as the normal letter it looks like.</p>
