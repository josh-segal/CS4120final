    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>So in the beginning... we had this new vector for a kind of heuristic, not 100% precise keylogger...</p>
    <p>...and wanted to compare it's performance with other approaches.</p>
    <p>However, neither were a lot of these other keyloggers available as source, nor were the performance metrics applicable and/or portable.</p>
    <p>Solution: Build our own.</p>

    <p>Challenges with this metric.</p>
    <p>Issue: Gets naturally higher, the longer the input is.</p>
    <p>Solution: Divide by the length of one (defined) input string: dl(real,captured)</p>
    <p>|characters(captured)|</p>
    <p>Issue: Now lower means better. This is counter intuitive.</p>
    <p>Solution: Subtract from 1, higher becomes better: 1  dl(real,captured)|characters(captured)|</p>

    <p>Tablet vs. Phone</p>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, getting one's hands on a keylogger is kind of hard. So we simulate two distinct keyloggers:</p>
    <p>Subjects exhibit a different typing speed due to the keyboard size.</p>
    <p>Implementation slightly differs between devices.</p>
    <p>The tablet has more CPU power.</p>

    <p>Filtering</p>
    <p>The analysis indicated some bias for the tablet implementation.</p>
    <p>Closer investigation revealed: Due to the stronger CPU the keylogger oversamples. Furthermore the space key is not recorded.</p>
    <p>Hence we filter the data. That is, we clean it of those effects introduced by the detected bias.</p>
    <p>In the case at hand this means the removal of all repeated characters and spaces.</p>

    <p>Points for further discussion...</p>
    <p>There are many open challenges:</p>
    <p>Semantic Properties should be incorporated into the metric.</p>
    <p>In the same manner the performance footprint of a keylogger should be incorporated as well.</p>
    <p>A database with evaluations for various presented keyloggers should be created for benchmarking purposes.</p>
