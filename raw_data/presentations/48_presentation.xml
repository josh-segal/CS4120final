    <p>P A Y L</p>
    <p>PAYLoad-based Anomaly Detector  Developed at Columbia University, NY</p>
    <p>Based on occurrence frequency of n-grams (sequences of n bytes) in the payload</p>
    <p>Training  Frequency of n-grams is extracted for each payload in a</p>
    <p>(noisy) dataset of normal traffic</p>
    <p>A simple model is constructed by computing the average and standard deviation of frequency of n-grams</p>
    <p>256n possible n-grams = 256n features</p>

    <p>Problems  PAYL assumes there is no correlation among features</p>
    <p>Uses 1-gram (or 2-gram) analysis because high values of n are impractical</p>

    <p>Polymorphism is used by attackers to avoid signaturebased detection</p>
    <p>1-gram and 2-gram PAYL can easily detect standard and Polymorphic attacks  normal HTTP requests are highly structured, they contain</p>
    <p>mostly printable characters</p>
    <p>the Executable Code, the Decryption Engine and the Encrypted Code contain lots of unusual characters (e.g., non-printable)</p>

    <p>Why does the Blending Attack work?</p>
    <p>Model of normal traffic constructed by PAYL is too simple</p>
    <p>1-gram and 2-gram analysis do not extract enough structural information</p>
    <p>Shortcomings of the attack</p>
    <p>Polymorphic Blending Attack uses a greedy algorithm to find a sub-optimal attack transformation</p>
    <p>The attack transformation is less and less likely to find a good solution for high values of n</p>

    <p>We introduced the 2-gram analysis technique to extract information from the payload</p>

    <p>We used an ensemble of classifiers to combine the structural information extracted with the 2-gram technique</p>

    <p>The attacker could evade our IDS if he was able to construct the attack transformation to approximate the distribution of (n/2+1)-grams in normal traffic</p>
    <p>However, the greedy attack transformation algorithm is unlikely to find a good solution if (n/2+1) is a sufficiently high value</p>
    <p>A new attack transformation algorithm specifically crafted to approximate the distribution of 2-grams has to evade at least n/2 different models at the same time</p>
    <p>The introduced overhead added to the operational phase is expected to be fairly low</p>
