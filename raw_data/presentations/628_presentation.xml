    <p>The 2-factor AuthN landscape</p>
    <p>SMS from SURFnet your login code is 32vj6k</p>
    <p>ok</p>

    <p>Drawbacks of traditional 2-factor AuthN solutions</p>
    <p>- Often involve additional physical tokens that users need to carry around</p>
    <p>- May require driver software on end-user workstations</p>
    <p>- Are proprietary in nature and incompatible with each other</p>
    <p>- Are usually single purpose (e.g. you cannot use bank As token for bank B as well)</p>

    <p>SURFnet. We make innovation work c b</p>
    <p>Something we all have (right?)</p>
    <p>- (Almost) everybody owns a mobile phone - A 2007 study in The Netherlands showed 19 million</p>
    <p>subscribers in a country with 16.5 million people</p>
    <p>- Most people always carry their mobile phone with them - A recent study by SecurEnvoy shows that one in three</p>
    <p>people notice their phone is missing in under an hour</p>
    <p>- There are already several options: - Mobile PKI (which we tried, http://bit.ly/mobile-pki) - SMS authentication - A host of Apps - SIM add-ons like Vasco DigiPass Nano</p>

    <p>One Friday afternoon... - As these things go, we started</p>
    <p>brainstorming...</p>
    <p>- What we most dislike about almost all solutions:</p>
    <p>Having to re-type complicated codes</p>
    <p>- So one Friday afternoon in September we started thinking...</p>

    <p>How does it work?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>SURFnet. We make innovation work c b</p>
    <p>Design and implementation - Fully based on Open Standards</p>
    <p>- Uses the OCRA suite developed by the Open Authentication (OATH) initiative</p>
    <p>- Uses the HOTP algorithm (RFC 4226)</p>
    <p>- AES 256-bit encryption</p>
    <p>- Uses the ZXing QR-code library by Google http://code.google.com/p/zxing/</p>
    <p>- QR code patent is royalty free 15</p>

    <p>Security audit - We contracted an external auditor</p>
    <p>- Goals of the audit were: - White box security testing - tiqr architecture and design analysis - Code audit</p>
    <p>- The audit was performed earlier this year</p>
    <p>- We got good feedback and fixed some issues</p>
    <p>- Status now: tiqr is a secure solution</p>
    <p>- Read the report: https://tiqr.org/audit/ 17</p>

    <p>roadmap - Available on Apples App Store</p>
    <p>- Available on Android Market</p>
    <p>- Release as Open Source</p>
    <p>- Security &amp; code audit</p>
    <p>- Partner with other solutions in progress</p>
    <p>- Other mobile platforms you? we?</p>
    <p>- Pilot with real users Q4 2011 Q1 2012</p>
