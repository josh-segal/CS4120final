    <p>The Quest for Automated Stress Measure</p>
    <p>Predicting psychological state from physiology  William James  pioneering work (1880)  John Cacioppo and others  revitalized interest (1990)</p>
    <p>Many emotion and stress prediction studies  Identified stress and emotion markers (Heart rate, skin conductance)  Mostly in controlled settings</p>
    <p>Few studies in uncontrolled environments  M. Myrtek (1996), J. Healey (2005), J. Healey (2010), Shi (2010)  Either no validated stressors, no lab session to train models, not able</p>
    <p>to account for confounders, or tried to match selfreports directly</p>

    <p>Conclusions and Future Work</p>
    <p>The longstanding question on whether stress can be measured automatically in the field has now been answered  The focus can now shift from Whether to How Well?  Three additional user studies (with 50+ subjects) in progress for</p>
    <p>additional refinement and validation of stress model</p>
    <p>New apps can now be developed for monitoring of stress and to help reduce stress in daily life  For example, to select a less stressful route for driving</p>
    <p>Mediators of stress can now be investigated in the field  For example, relationship between stress, smoking, drinking, physical</p>
    <p>activity, entertainment, etc.</p>
