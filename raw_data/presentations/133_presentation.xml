    <p>A home away from school Day care has after-school duties as some clients start academic year By Kristen Roderick - The Hutchinson News kroderick@hutchnews.com</p>
    <p>(Travis Morisse/The Hutchinson News) Mary Waln, 7, and Nija Morris, 6, read The Magic Mat together Wednesday at Hadley Day Care.</p>
    <p>The doors at Hadley Day Care opened Wednesday afternoon, and children scurried in with tales of their first day of school.</p>
    <p>Nija Morris, a 6-year-old attending Faris Elementary, smiled as she hung her pink-and-blue flowered backpack on a hook and talked to her classmates about her first day.</p>
    <p>&quot;I played and I did art and I played outside and I went to the gym, and I went inside and did centers,&quot; she said. &quot;And then I went to meet the other classes and then we went home.&quot;</p>
    <p>The school-aged children were a little more wound up on Wednesday, program director Christie Gardner said. The excitement is always higher the first day of school, and not everyone is in a routine.</p>
