    <p>The routing of the consumers workload into the cloud is described by a market-oriented discrete-time model.</p>
    <p>Servers communicate with brokers letting them know how busy they are.</p>
    <p>Brokers distribute the consumers workload to be processed by the servers based on the current status of the servers.</p>
    <p>This framework takes advantage of the passivity inherited by a system formed by interconnected passive subsystems.</p>

    <p>Proposition</p>
    <p>Consider the state-space dynamics of the j-th broker defined by (1) and (2). For any initial condition d(k0) such that d(k0) &gt; w(k) = w &gt; 0 with w  R</p>

    <p>Simulation Results Conclusions</p>
    <p>Remark</p>
    <p>Notice that for the case w(k) = w = 0 the foregoing Proposition does not apply, since from [Lemmon, 2012], d(k)  0 as k   asymptotically, i.e., in infinite time.</p>
    <p>Remark</p>
    <p>In the foregoing Proposition we do not consider the case where the projection of d(k) is active because the main assumption is d(k) &gt; 0.</p>

    <p>We have presented an in depth analysis of the passivity framework introduced in [Lemmon, 2012] for power control and response time management in the cloud.</p>
    <p>We have formally provided an additional condition for the asymptotic stability of the market-oriented cloud model.</p>
    <p>Additional assumptions to justify the use of the passivity approach to guarantee asymptotic stability have been provided.</p>
    <p>We have formally proven that the the cloud model is ISS in the presence of time-varying consumers workload vectors.</p>

    <p>Proof Proposition 1</p>
    <p>Let us define a new state variable</p>
    <p>d0(k) = d(k)  w(k) + 2</p>
    <p>1 u(k), (7)</p>
    <p>therefore, we obtain the new dynamical equation,</p>
    <p>d0(k + 1) = (1  1)d0(k), 1  (0, 1). (8)</p>
    <p>Now, let us propose the following Lyapunov function candidate,</p>
    <p>V3(d0) = d 2 0 (k),</p>

    <p>Simulation Results Conclusions</p>
    <p>Proof Proposition 1</p>
    <p>The first difference gives,</p>
    <p>V3 = (1 + (1  1) 2)d20 (k)  0, (9)</p>
    <p>and the origin of (8) is asymptotically stable. Let us assume an initial condition d0(k) &gt; w. Furthermore, from (9) we know that for any d0(k) &gt; 0 there exists   R</p>
    <p>+</p>
    <p>such that</p>
    <p>V3 &lt; (1 + (1  1) 2)d20 (k) &lt; ,</p>
    <p>therefore, V3(k + 1)  V3(k) &lt; ,</p>

    <p>Simulation Results Conclusions</p>
    <p>Proof Proposition 1</p>
    <p>Solving the recurrence equation we get,</p>
    <p>V3(k)  V3(k0)  (k  k0), (10)</p>
    <p>If we take any feasible   R+ in the trajectory of d(k) such that d(k0) &gt;  &gt; 0 we get V3() =</p>
    <p>2  V3(d(k0))  (k  k0),</p>

    <p>Proof Proposition 1</p>
    <p>Therefore,</p>
    <p>k  k0 + V3(k0)</p>
    <p>&lt; .</p>
    <p>Then, the number of steps required to go from any initial state d0(k0) &gt; 0 to another state d0(k) &gt; 0 in the trajectory of the solution of (8) is finite. From (7) we conclude that starting from an initial state d(k0), there exists N  Z</p>
    <p>+, N &lt;  such that 0 &lt; d(k)  w, k &gt; k0 + N, therefore, y(k) = min{w, d(k)} = d(k) &gt; 0, k &gt; k0 + N.</p>

    <p>Proof Proposition 3</p>
    <p>Let us study the broker system defined by (1) and (2), and let us define,</p>
    <p>e1 = w(k)  2</p>
    <p>1 u(k),</p>
    <p>then, the system (1) may be rewritten as,</p>
    <p>d(k + 1) = [(1  1)d(k) + 1e1] + . (12)</p>
    <p>Assuming no active projection in (12), we note that the system is Linear Time Invariant (LTI). Based on [Lemmon, 2012] the origin with e1(k) = 0 is asymptotically stable. Since the system is LTI we conclude that it is Bounded-Input-Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable as well.</p>

    <p>Proof Proposition 3</p>
    <p>Similarly, the origin of the server system given by (5), (6) and (3) was proven to be stable with y(k) = 0. Assuming no active projection, the system is LTI, therefore, it is BIBO stable. Assuming an active projection in the server system the system matrix A becomes,</p>
    <p>A =</p>
    <p>(</p>
    <p>)</p>
    <p>,</p>
    <p>and the system is LTI, therefore it is BIBO stable.</p>

    <p>Proof Proposition 3</p>
    <p>Furthermore, with y(k) &lt;  and y(k) = R(k)y(k) where all the entries of R(k), namely, Rij(k)  [0, 1], then y(k) &lt; . Since u(k) = Q(k)u1(k) where the entries of Q(k), namely, Qji(k)  [0, 1], then u(k) &lt; . Finally, since we know that 2</p>
    <p>1 u(k) &lt;  and w(k) &lt; , then</p>
    <p>w(k)  2 2 u(k) &lt; , and the system is ISS.</p>
    <p>If in addition, (4) is satisfied, then the system tracks the equilibrium points asymptotically.</p>

    <p>Assuming that projection in (5) is inactive the first difference of the corresponding storage function is,</p>

    <p>Now, using the same storage function but assuming that the projection in (5) is active we obtain,</p>

    <p>+2s(k)y(k)</p>
