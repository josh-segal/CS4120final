    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Situation awareness applications on edge  -&gt; low-latency between sensing and actuation</p>
    <p>Cloud-based data management  -&gt; inevitable high latency</p>
    <p>Bandwidth intensive IoT platforms  -&gt; pressure on backhual bandwidth to transport data to the Cloud</p>
    <p>The need to build a datastore at the edge of the network</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges</p>
    <p>Wide geo-distribution and heterogeneous of the edge infrastructure  -&gt; data-partitioning and replication policies</p>
    <p>Scarcity of resources at the Edge  -&gt; interplay b/w the Edge (for low-latency) and the Cloud (for abundance of resources)</p>
    <p>Resources at the Edge are more prone to failures  Susceptible to geographically correlated failures</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Use case: Suspicious vehicle tracking</p>
    <p>Spatio-temporal range queries such as</p>
    <p>select all vehicle detections within</p>
    <p>The distribution of workload is</p>
    <p>dependent on the distribution of</p>
    <p>vehicles in space, leading to hotspots</p>
    <p>For continuous operation, continuous</p>
    <p>streams of vehicle detections have to</p>
    <p>be saved in a datastore</p>

    <p>Key Characteristics</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>DataFog</p>
    <p>A system that performs data partitioning between the Edge and the Cloud based on contextual relevance of data-items in space and time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Locality-aware distributed indexing</p>
    <p>Data-items are indexed based on their</p>
    <p>spatio-temporal attributes (e.g.</p>
    <p>Geohash)</p>
    <p>Consistent hashing for the location,</p>
    <p>timestamp and item-type attributes is</p>
    <p>used for partitioning data across nodes</p>
    <p>{ metric : ACV2351, location : { latitude : 33.42553, longitude : -84.74456 } timestamp : 1520123197 }</p>

    <p>Geohash H(metric) H(timeId)</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Replication Policy</p>
    <p>Load-balancing and fault-tolerance</p>
    <p>Multiple replicas on Edge nodes for low</p>
    <p>latency</p>
    <p>Multiple replicas on remote datacenter</p>
    <p>nodes for tolerance from</p>
    <p>geographically correlated failures</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Handling workload skews</p>
    <p>Load-balancing region  Partition key -&gt; virtual node -&gt; physical</p>
    <p>node  Mechanisms for adapting to hotspots</p>
    <p>Long-lived: launch and attach new datastore nodes to the running cluster</p>
    <p>Short-lived: offload heavily loaded nodess data items to lightly loaded nodes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Handling scarce resources at the edge</p>
    <p>TTL-based data eviction  Real-time analytics on temporal data</p>
    <p>Batch-processing requires data spanning over a large period of time</p>
    <p>Data aggregation and compression  Omit redundant metadata to increase efficiency of storage utilization</p>
    <p>Isomorphism of time series data</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Preliminary Evaluation</p>
    <p>Locality-aware distributed indexing</p>
    <p>SUMO to simulate vehicles movement in Georgia Tech campus equipped with</p>
    <p>MaxiNet to simulate 4 edge nodes within the campus and 4 remote nodes (CA,</p>
    <p>WA, IL and FL) on Microsoft Azure</p>
    <p>Range query: select all vehicle detections within 5km and 10 minutes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Cont</p>
    <p>Compared to a location-agnostic indexing done by off-the-shelf Cassandra</p>
    <p>Replication factor: 3  When the number of remote</p>
    <p>nodes is 3 or greater, some data items end up having replicas only on remote nodes making the higher percentiles of latencies becoming higher</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Open issues: Interaction between datastore platforms owned by different stakeholders leads to a need of communication protocols and business models for sharing data across multiple edge administrative domains.</p>
