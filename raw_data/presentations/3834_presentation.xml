    <p>Related Work</p>
    <p>Wearable Fitness Data Sharing</p>
    <p>Motivations: accountability, social support, and competition (Dong et al., 2018).</p>
    <p>Primarily studied on social media (Gui et al., 2017), and within workplaces (Gorm et</p>
    <p>al., 2016).</p>
    <p>Privacy Concerns</p>
    <p>Concerns over location information (Motti et al., 2015), unintended use, and lack of</p>
    <p>control (Lowens et al., 2017).</p>
    <p>Some services do not comply with regulations of data practices (Paul et al., 2014).</p>
    <p>Users have limited knowledge of those practices (Vitak et al., 2018).</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Study Goals</p>
    <p>Privacy is the selective control of access to the self (Altman, 1977)</p>
    <p>Our goals:</p>
    <p>Explore broad sharing practices of long-term users</p>
    <p>Understand what privacy-related decisions users make</p>
    <p>when disclosing sensed fitness data</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Interview Study</p>
    <p>Participants</p>
    <p>(&gt;= three months of use) + shared some info</p>
    <p>30 participants (15 M, 15 F)</p>
    <p>Ages: 20- 51 (avg. 32)</p>
    <p>Variety of commercial fitness devices</p>
    <p>Interview questions</p>
    <p>General usage and motivations</p>
    <p>Sharing practices  who, where, when, why, how</p>
    <p>Privacy concerns and behaviors</p>
    <p>Duration: avg. 25 minutes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>General Usage</p>
    <p>Goals include activity tracking, accountability, and medical</p>
    <p>tracking.</p>
    <p>Most use their devices at all times, others during</p>
    <p>workouts.</p>
    <p>Participants review their data regularly in the device or on</p>
    <p>the app.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals:</p>
    <p>Accountability; competition;</p>
    <p>bragging</p>
    <p>Common sensed data only</p>
    <p>Primarily on social media channels</p>
    <p>After good physical performance</p>
    <p>Friends</p>
    <p>I'm only sharing certain things</p>
    <p>like pictures, my badges, and my</p>
    <p>daily step counts with my</p>
    <p>friends</p>
    <p>like the weight loss aspect, I</p>
    <p>don't need them to know how</p>
    <p>much I weigh</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals:</p>
    <p>Mutual and emotional</p>
    <p>encouragements</p>
    <p>Disclose more information to family</p>
    <p>Simple ways to communicate data</p>
    <p>outside of platform</p>
    <p>Family</p>
    <p>If I share it with more people, I</p>
    <p>would have chosen which</p>
    <p>specific pieces of information,</p>
    <p>but I will still share everything</p>
    <p>with my wife</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals:</p>
    <p>Feedback &amp; advise regarding</p>
    <p>shared goals</p>
    <p>A variety of non-identifiable</p>
    <p>information related to fitness goals</p>
    <p>Device social circle, or external</p>
    <p>online communities</p>
    <p>May use fake identifiers</p>
    <p>Strangers</p>
    <p>They are also on the same</p>
    <p>journey so I feel like it is for</p>
    <p>accountability and they are not</p>
    <p>going to use that information in</p>
    <p>a way that would negatively</p>
    <p>affect me</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals:</p>
    <p>Tracking vital signs &amp;</p>
    <p>medical conditions</p>
    <p>Share openly and record data</p>
    <p>precisely</p>
    <p>Compile and report data manually</p>
    <p>Physicians</p>
    <p>I had back surgery in October</p>
    <p>so I use it as a tool to make sure</p>
    <p>that I am maintaining my</p>
    <p>recovery from my surgery.</p>
    <p>With regard to doctors, I share</p>
    <p>almost everything that I can</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals:</p>
    <p>Receive financial</p>
    <p>discounts/rewards</p>
    <p>Mostly step count</p>
    <p>Provide permission to access data</p>
    <p>directly in the device</p>
    <p>Wear the device continuously to</p>
    <p>maximize metrics</p>
    <p>Incentive</p>
    <p>Programs</p>
    <p>It is free money, but I never</p>
    <p>been giving away something</p>
    <p>confidential. I was giving away</p>
    <p>the number of steps or my</p>
    <p>weight. There is nothing that I</p>
    <p>need to keep secret.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals:</p>
    <p>Increase physical activity;</p>
    <p>competition</p>
    <p>Sharing step count only</p>
    <p>On the employer portal</p>
    <p>Set regular step goals and compete</p>
    <p>with other workmates</p>
    <p>Co-workers</p>
    <p>When I originally started</p>
    <p>wearing it's because of the</p>
    <p>competition. You don't wanna be</p>
    <p>at the bottom of the list of your</p>
    <p>co-workers so you wanna be</p>
    <p>more active</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Privacy Concerns</p>
    <p>The overwhelming perception was wearable fitness data</p>
    <p>is harmless:</p>
    <p>Self-image and social norms were the primary concern:</p>
    <p>A few participants were concerned about repurposing</p>
    <p>I wouldn't really care if someone knew how many</p>
    <p>steps I have taken</p>
    <p>I'm not going to share my blood oxygenation level</p>
    <p>with friends or in public. That would be ridiculous.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>A few participants utilized fake identifiers or providing</p>
    <p>minimal account information:</p>
    <p>Some were not aware of privacy settings:</p>
    <p>&quot;I don't know how much of it is personalized because</p>
    <p>my registration and stuff is under a fake name.</p>
    <p>Little effort towards data protection</p>
    <p>I think it came default sharing everything, but I cannot</p>
    <p>remember because I bought this so long time ago</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>Users perceive sensed fitness data as not sensitive</p>
    <p>Disclosure decisions impacted by:</p>
    <p>Fitness goals and incentives</p>
    <p>Social norms of the audience and platform</p>
    <p>Design Implications:</p>
    <p>Controls and features around common goals and patterns</p>
    <p>Methods for sharing with caregivers</p>
    <p>Privacy Nudges</p>
