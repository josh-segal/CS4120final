    <p>MOTIVATION</p>
    <p>Distributed systems programming is still very hard:  How to manage state?</p>
    <p>How do we manage concurrency?</p>
    <p>How do we leverage parallelism?</p>
    <p>Distributed actors are good! (and, a good match to distributed systems, too!)  Encapsulation for state</p>
    <p>Pervasive concurrency  thousands of actors working together</p>
    <p>Asynchronous messaging  no shared memory between actors</p>
    <p>Transparent messaging and serialization  easy programming model!</p>
    <p>Demonstrated success:  Erlang: Call of Duty, League of Legends, WhatsApp</p>
    <p>Orleans: Halo, Gears of War</p>

    <p>DISTRIBUTED ACTORS: TODAYS DRAWBACKS</p>
    <p>Scalability</p>
    <p>All-to-all communication is expensive and prohibitive</p>
    <p>Nodes need to know about all other nodes</p>
    <p>Latency</p>
    <p>Multiplexed TCP connection is a bottleneck</p>
    <p>Many actors reduced to a single connections speed</p>
    <p>Congestion:</p>
    <p>network latency, queueing delay</p>
    <p>Contention:</p>
    <p>competing for shared resources, slow-sender vs. fast-sender</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>PARTISAN</p>
    <p>Design of an alternative runtime system for distributed actor systems  Design and prototype implementation in Erlang</p>
    <p>Runtime selection of communications overlay network  Specialize overlay selection to communications pattern of application</p>
    <p>No modification to application code</p>
    <p>Provides reduced latency and increased scalability  Enable parallelism on the network</p>
    <p>Schedule messages efficiently on the network</p>
    <p>Results:  Order of magnitude increase in cluster size</p>
    <p>Up to 13.5x reduction in latency and 38.07x increase in throughput</p>
