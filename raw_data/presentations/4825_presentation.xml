    <p>Idea  how does a &quot;story develop (in news, blogs,...)?  graphical multi-document summarization (+ text)  interactive, dynamic customisation of content and</p>

    <p>Context</p>
    <p>Family of tools focussing on interactive sensemaking helped by data mining</p>
    <p>PORPOISE: global and local analysis of news and blogs + their relations ; some multilinguality</p>
    <p>CiteseerCluster: literature search + sensemaking</p>
    <p>Damilicious: CiteseerCluster + re-use/transfer of semantics + diversity</p>
