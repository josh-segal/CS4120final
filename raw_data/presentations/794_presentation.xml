    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Many students were excited about security and motivated to</p>
    <p>compete in online CTF competitions.</p>
    <p>BUT,</p>
    <p>- They easily give up after competing in a few online CTF</p>
    <p>competitions (just like giving up games if they do not see chances</p>
    <p>of winning and then move on to other games.) - They do not have ideas on how to prepare so that they could solve</p>
    <p>at least one challenge in the competitions.</p>
    <p>- They do not have a set of excises and an easy-to-use platform to practice and develop their security knowledge and skills.</p>
    <p>So, we adopted a data-based approach to design exercises for</p>
    <p>beginners to grow their interests and skills in computer security.</p>

    <p>Contribution</p>
    <p>A study centered around beginner</p>
    <p>Showed the main characteristics of the past security challenges</p>
    <p>Identified the main security issues concerned in the security</p>
    <p>community</p>
    <p>Highlighted the main knowledge and skills used in the</p>
    <p>competitions</p>
    <p>Provided a training platform based on PicoCTF</p>
    <p>Deployed a set of exercises based on the analysis of the past</p>
    <p>security challenges</p>
    <p>Enabled them to study and practice by themselves</p>

    <p>Class Settings</p>
    <p>CTF exercises were a part of individual homework assignments</p>
    <p>Provided partial solutions on the key steps</p>
    <p>- Guide the students with example techniques on the most challenging steps</p>
    <p>- Ask the students to figure out the missing steps and complete the</p>
    <p>exercises by themselves</p>
    <p>Minimum intervention from the instructor</p>
    <p>- To enable beginners to learn and practice by themselves</p>
    <p>- To enable beginners to build technical and psychological</p>
    <p>confidence by themselves</p>
    <p>Anonymous survey to get feedback from the students</p>

    <p>Observations</p>
    <p>Usage issues:</p>
    <p>Several students were using tablet computers that do not support</p>
    <p>Virtual Box.</p>
    <p>Many students did not have enough computer administration skills to install and setup the needed tools and libraries.</p>
    <p>- Many tools and libraries are Linux-based. - Many students use Windows and Mac OS X.</p>
    <p>About 13% of students gave up on the exercises due to these</p>
