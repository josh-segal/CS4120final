    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>Provide a holistic model that highlights how undergraduate students use workarounds and live in constant state of watchfulness to manage their privacy in the face of surveillance from pervasiveness photography and social media</p>
    <p>Build a design opportunity map that highlights how designs can address users' privacy concerns over a digital photos lifespan, both on individual stages and across stages.</p>
