    <p>Motivation for Building EDURange</p>
    <p>Existing testbeds have certain limitations</p>
    <p>As instructors, we were looking for: flexibility scalability analysis skills</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Analysis Skills</p>
    <p>Verify Assumptions using network messages, error messages, system calls, static analysis</p>
    <p>Matching actual system behavior with predicted behavior</p>
    <p>Extracting information from opaque artifacts  Creating resilience based on understanding</p>
    <p>failure modes</p>

    <p>The EDURange Architecture</p>
    <p>Hosted on EC2 Minimal client</p>
    <p>requirements</p>
    <p>Currently 6 scenarios (reconnaissance, binary analysis, network topology discovery, )</p>

    <p>Types of Exercises</p>
    <p>Reconnaissance: finding hosts with open ports on a complex network</p>
    <p>Fuzzing a calculator  Crafting packets to find data on a hidden host  Analyzing system calls by an unknown process  Finding malware within a linkable file format</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Lessons Learned</p>
    <p>Techno-pedagogical challenges Students need significant scaffolding No client software to install, but distributing</p>
    <p>credentials was a speed bump Faculty want exercises they can use right away Everyone is proposing a cybertraining environment,</p>
    <p>why is this task more subtle than many anticipate?</p>
