    <p>Strategies Students Discovered</p>
    <p>Silent werewolves  Successful Werewolves strategy</p>
    <p>Solution: Shift the balance of powers using knob</p>
    <p>Create many system calls  Unsuccessful Werewolves strategy to hide their identities</p>
    <p>Find shadow file  If you are not cheating, you are not trying.</p>
    <p>Chang identity  During chat phase, make a town person</p>
    <p>look like a werewolf.</p>

    <p>Lessons Learned</p>
    <p>Server design  Great student enthusiasm</p>
    <p>All students were challenged, but still able to contribute.</p>
    <p>Continuously engaging students  Feedback loop</p>
    <p>Interesting discussions about info. flow, and game theory</p>
