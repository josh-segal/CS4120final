  <div class="page">
    <p>What and Why</p>
    <p>Existing agent languages and architectures  Mostly deal with actions and plans</p>
    <p>Multi-agent techniques  Ad-Hoc</p>
    <p>Gap between language expressivity and available techniques  Solution: extend existing languages</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>BDI Agents</p>
    <p>Based on a philosophical model by Bratman  Describes agents in terms of:</p>
    <p>Beliefs: information about the world  Desires: preferred world-states  Intentions: commitments to achieve desires</p>
    <p>Large body of research on BDI agent architectures</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>AgentSpeak(L)</p>
    <p>Agent language that describes procedural plans</p>
    <p>Based on a series of previous BDI architectures and languages  Based on a simplification of the BDI model  Main goal was get a responsive system  Ties plan execution with goal achievement</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Declarative Goals</p>
    <p>World states which an agent intends to hold  Decouple plan execution from goal</p>
    <p>achievement  Not vulnerable to a poor plan selection strategy  More runtime flexibility</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>AgentSpeak-PL</p>
    <p>AgentSpeak(L) interpreter extended with planning capabilities</p>
    <p>State-space planning is always towards declarative goals</p>
    <p>AgentSpeak-PL supports declarative goals</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>AgentSpeak-PL (detail)</p>
    <p>Planner encapsulated within an action  Planning allows the creation of high-level</p>
    <p>plans  New plans are added to the plan library</p>
    <p>improving the agent over time  Allows for shorter, declarative goal</p>
    <p>descriptions</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Meta-reasoning</p>
    <p>Reasoning about the reasoning process  Guides the selection of goals and actions</p>
    <p>Important in declarative agent architectures  Few current efforts</p>
    <p>All rely on some static strategy  Need a specification language</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivations</p>
    <p>Root cause of future-directed behaviour  Orientation towards certain classes of goals  Varying degrees of intensity</p>
    <p>Interesting abstraction for meta-reasoning</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>AgentSpeak-MPL</p>
    <p>AgentSpeak(L) interpreter extended with a motivations-based meta-level controller</p>
    <p>Includes a motivation specification language  Intuitive way of describing meta-reasoning  Extensive research on the subject</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>AgentSpeak-MPL (detail)</p>
    <p>Can be applied to both procedural and declarative agents (e.g. AgentSpeak-PL)  Separation of action-directed plans from</p>
    <p>internal management code (procedural)  Enforcement of rationality constraints on goal</p>
    <p>and plan selection (declarative)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Results</p>
    <p>Journal paper in Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience</p>
    <p>Workshop paper in Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies</p>
    <p>Written and submitted paper for the Central and Eastern European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Future Work</p>
    <p>Multiagent AgentSpeak  Selection of partners and actions  Norms, contracts and commitments</p>
    <p>Apply meta-level reasoning in MAAgentSpeak  How to cooperate  When to do so</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Future Work (cont)</p>
    <p>Explore possibilities of  Joint plans  Plan sharing</p>
