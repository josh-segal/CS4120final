    <p>Latency</p>
    <p>Latency as a first class concern</p>
    <p>With mobile devices, the reach is extending</p>
    <p>Latency is difficult:</p>
    <p>Simply packing more bits doesnt improve it</p>
    <p>It has a hard upper bound</p>
    <p>Additional services impact it the most</p>
    <p>Its doesnt sell:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Humans and latency</p>
    <p>We are very sensitive to delay and jitter</p>
    <p>Even in systems with adequate balance</p>
    <p>Humans notice even a modest increase in latency</p>
    <p>Experiments with streaming, interactive services</p>
    <p>At a few hundred millisecs, many applications degrade</p>
    <p>All too common in mobile connectivity</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Latency in challenged networks</p>
    <p>Even more pronounced in many scenarios</p>
    <p>Mobile connectivity</p>
    <p>Shared access centers</p>
    <p>Makes even simple network tasks unpleasant</p>
    <p>We have been looking at bandwidth primarily</p>
    <p>Several approaches towards improving access</p>
    <p>Some of these approaches help with latency too</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Spoiler</p>
    <p>Provisioning data as close to demand as possible</p>
    <p>Trading latency for storage and bandwidth</p>
    <p>The moving cloud:</p>
    <p>Proposing a framework for proactive data delivery</p>
    <p>Partial validation for components</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Themes in the moving cloud</p>
    <p>People are creatures of habit  Move in patterns that can be probabilistically learned</p>
    <p>Access data in patterns*</p>
    <p>Improved Delivery</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>An Example: Cyber foraging</p>
    <p>Augmenting computation with local surrogates</p>
    <p>Cut on the latency to reach the cloud</p>
    <p>Perform computationally intensive tasks on mobile devices</p>
    <p>Computation as a replaceable resource</p>
    <p>Can be provisioned by nearby machines</p>
    <p>Often a single hop away</p>
    <p>Try to define units of computation to offload  not easy</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Cloudlets</p>
    <p>The latest in cyber foraging</p>
    <p>Data centers in a box</p>
    <p>Can be deployed alongside wireless access points</p>
    <p>Provide on-demand augmentation</p>
    <p>Use virtual machines to encapsulate computation</p>
    <p>Base VM at public nodes, and private overlays</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The moving cloud and cloudlets</p>
    <p>Cloudlets augment computation</p>
    <p>However, VM matching and updating is hard</p>
    <p>Many overlays to work with various base VMs</p>
    <p>Updates are difficult to propagate</p>
    <p>The moving cloud simplifies targeted, proactive delivery</p>
    <p>Can be used to implement the cloudlet idea</p>
    <p>Deliver targeted VMs ahead of time</p>
    <p>Employ techniques for smarter and efficient delivery</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>High level design</p>
    <p>Key principles: Proactive placement Extensibility Access models</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Application model</p>
    <p>An application will have two components</p>
    <p>Server based component:  Deals with high fidelity, first level replica of its data</p>
    <p>A mobile component:  Provides the user facing interactions</p>
    <p>Interacts with augmentation nodes</p>
    <p>A node is a publicly available storage and compute node</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Application interaction model</p>
    <p>As updates to data happen in the wild:</p>
    <p>Changes propagate back to the server component</p>
    <p>Server component deals with data semantics</p>
    <p>The moving cloud should support a simple set of APIs</p>
    <p>Pushing data into the service</p>
    <p>Accessing data from nodes</p>
    <p>Harvesting state from nodes</p>
    <p>Versioning data pieces</p>
    <p>Providing contextual access information</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Mobility</p>
    <p>Several models for capturing human mobility</p>
    <p>Algorithms to predict next location of individuals</p>
    <p>Some with very good success, close to 90%</p>
    <p>We worked on adding time bounds to location prediction</p>
    <p>Important for proactive data delivery</p>
    <p>Provides actionable information</p>
    <p>Needed to deliver fresh data</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Mobility</p>
    <p>Approaches:</p>
    <p>Fingerprints to identify distinct routes</p>
    <p>Probabilistically analyzing associated route times</p>
    <p>A route is a recorded mobility edge between two nodes</p>
    <p>Has an identifying precedent (its fingerprint)</p>
    <p>A measured time of travel</p>
    <p>Fingerprint A B M</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Time augmentation</p>
    <p>M captures the statistical distribution of route times</p>
    <p>Used to estimate expected route time</p>
    <p>For the fingerprint, we use the previous two locations</p>
    <p>For the following route, (A,B) is used as the fingerprint:</p>
    <p>A fingerprint is not unique, can lead to multiple routes</p>
    <p>A B C C D</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Time augmentation</p>
    <p>A second order Markov chain to represent fingerprints</p>
    <p>A fingerprint matrix</p>
    <p>A sparse matrix used to decide on route choices</p>
    <p>The Markov chain is used to select next possible route</p>
    <p>Statistical distribution is used to estimate route time</p>
    <p>Capture deviation from ground truth to estimate error</p>
    <p>Used to establish time bound confidence</p>
    <p>Good first results with the CROWDAD mobility data</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Contextual access behavior</p>
    <p>Data access patterns used for system design</p>
    <p>Temporal and spatial locality in access</p>
    <p>Clusters of files accessed together</p>
    <p>We posit access can be correlated with context of access</p>
    <p>For example: location and time</p>
    <p>office data vs. home data</p>
    <p>Patterns emerge over time, and can be used for delivery</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Applications in challenged networks</p>
    <p>Predictors work well in the absence of detailed location</p>
    <p>Location at the granularity of internet kiosks, for example</p>
    <p>Pushing data proactively reduces access latency</p>
    <p>However, special sensitivity to prediction confidence</p>
    <p>Since resources are limited to begin with</p>
    <p>We have modified Sulula to support this style of delivery</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>A few challenges/directions</p>
    <p>Consistency models</p>
    <p>Data that was consistent at delivery might not remain so</p>
    <p>Harvesting residual state from nodes is important</p>
    <p>Vertical and horizontal consistency</p>
    <p>Need robust versioning and consistency</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges</p>
    <p>Improving prediction certainty</p>
    <p>Especially important in constrained environments</p>
    <p>Utility models for deciding data placement</p>
    <p>Dealing with phase changes in human mobility</p>
    <p>Quick learning when errors increase</p>
    <p>Enough memory to revert back to old routines</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges</p>
    <p>System level support for modeling access context</p>
    <p>A lot of work in the space of application hints</p>
    <p>For optimizing network and energy use</p>
    <p>Capturing and communicating patterns in access context</p>
