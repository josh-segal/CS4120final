    <p>That Was Then, This Is Now: A Security Evaluation of Password</p>
    <p>Generation, Storage, and Autofill in Browser-Based Password Managers</p>

    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Passwords are still the dominant form of authentication, but they have serious shortcomings</p>
    <p>Password managers can help users generate strong, unique passwords, but how secure are the password managers themselves?</p>

    <p>Autofill, Generation, and Storage Recommended behaviors and security concerns</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Autofill</p>
    <p>Require user interaction before filling credential  Prevents automatic credential scraping</p>
    <p>Increases the probably the user can detect attacks</p>
    <p>Refuse to fill forms in iframes  Significantly reduces the attack surface</p>
    <p>Refuse to submit password over insecure connections</p>
    <p>Avoid filling suspicious forms</p>

    <p>Generation</p>
    <p>Generate passwords that are resilient to online/offline attack  Resist ~106 guesses for online resilience</p>
    <p>Resist ~1014 guesses for offline resilience</p>
    <p>Preserve safe settings  Default: length 20, all character sets</p>
    <p>Modify: length 8, letters and digits</p>
    <p>Should restore default secure settings after modification</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Random But Weak Passwords</p>
    <p>Most randomly generated passwords are resilient to online and offline attacks</p>
    <p>A small portion will be trivially guessed by brute force attacks  LastPass - 17M users, generate 1</p>
    <p>password each, 730 weak passwords</p>
    <p>Probability is negligible for sufficiently long passwords  10 characters for online resistance  18 characters for offline resistance</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Storage</p>
    <p>Master password should be strong  Single point of failure</p>
    <p>Strong Key Derivation Function (KDF) should be used</p>
    <p>Metadata should be encrypted</p>

    <p>Wrap-up Recommendations and future work</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusion  Recommendations  Require user interaction for autofill  Filter weak passwords during generation  Better master password policies for storage</p>
    <p>Future Work  Browser-supported password managers  Safer autofill</p>
    <p>Research-derived character sets  HTML-supported password generation  Mobile password managers</p>
