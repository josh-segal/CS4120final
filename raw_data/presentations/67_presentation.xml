    <p>Computation-Friendly Game Representations</p>
    <p>In practice, interesting games are large; computing equilibrium is hard</p>
    <p>CS agenda  compact representation  tractable computation</p>
    <p>Independence  some agents have no (direct) effect on each others payoffs</p>
    <p>[La Mura, 2000], [Kearns, Littman, Singh, 2001], [Vickrey &amp; Koller, 2002], [Oritz &amp; Kearns, 2003], [Blum, Shelton, Koller, 2003]</p>
    <p>Symmetry and Anonymity  all agents have the same utility function  agents affect each other in the same way</p>

    <p>Congestion Games: Example</p>
    <p>Simplified congestion games: one resource per action  D(a) is the number of agents who choose action a  Fa() are arbitrary functions for each a  agent is utility:</p>

    <p>Congestion and Potential Games</p>
    <p>Congestion games [Rosenthal, 1973]  set of resources R, actions A, each action a  A is a subset of R</p>
    <p>agent is action choices come from Ai  A  D(r) is the number of agents who chose actions a | r  a  Fr() are arbitrary functions for each r  R  agent is utility:</p>
    <p>especially interesting: always have pure strategy Nash equilibria</p>
    <p>Potential games [Monderer &amp; Shapley, 1996]  let X and Y be tuples of agents action choices,</p>
    <p>differing only in the choice of agent i</p>
    <p>there exists a function P where P(X)  P(Y) = ui(X)  ui(Y)  equivalent to congestion games</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Local-Effect Games</p>
    <p>Sometimes, an agent is made to pay more because another agent chooses a different but related action</p>
    <p>location problem: ice cream vendors on the beach  role formation game: choose skill in which to specialize</p>
    <p>Express relationships between actions with a local-effect graph  a node for every action a, labeled with a node function Fa,a()  a directed edge from action a to action a' if a affects a ', labeled Fa,a()</p>
    <p>neigh(a) is the set of actions that locally affect agents who choose action a</p>
    <p>Our Setting:  symmetry: every agent has same action choices and utility function  anonymity: every agent affects other agents in the same way  node and edge functions strictly monotonic  connections bidirectional (but functions can differ on directed edges)  local effects additive</p>

    <p>Other Cases</p>
    <p>We can find pure strategy Nash equilibria even in cases where no potential function exists</p>
    <p>Theorem 4 When  node effect functions dominate edge effect functions  edge effect functions are sublinear</p>
    <p>then there exists a PSNE in which agents choose nodes that constitute an independent set</p>
    <p>There are LEGs for which no PSNE exists  verified by exhaustive enumeration of pure strategies</p>

    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>Local-Effect Games offer a novel compact representation  exploiting symmetry, anonymity, additivity and</p>
    <p>context-specific independence in utility functions</p>
    <p>very natural graphical representation</p>
    <p>LEGs not equivalent to potential/congestion games  we characterized exactly which LEGs are potential games</p>
    <p>Many LEGs have pure-strategy Nash equilibria  three subclasses shown theoretically  however, PSNE do not always exist</p>
    <p>Even when LEGs cannot be proven to have PSNE, equilibria can often be found experimentally using myopic best-response dynamics</p>

    <p>Bidirectional Local Effect Games</p>
    <p>A B</p>
    <p>First sum: congestion game cost function (summing over agents)  we know every congestion game has a potential function  since PFs are additive, we can use this function to explain node functions if we can</p>
    <p>find another term to capture the effect of edge functions</p>
    <p>Global utility change due to local effects when agent deviates from D to D is:</p>
    <p>from linearity &amp; bidirectionality, aggregate utility change imposed on all other agents is the same as the utility change imposed on self</p>

    <p>The graph is a clique  the only node that does not locally affect an agent is the node</p>
    <p>corresponding to her action</p>
    <p>Consider P(D) - P(D), where D, D differ for only one agent:  the only terms that do not cancel out from the second summation are the</p>
