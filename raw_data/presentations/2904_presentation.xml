    <p>Background</p>
    <p>Machine Learning Platform was built 2 years ago</p>
    <p>Aid Data Scientists in developing ML models</p>
    <p>effectively and efficiently</p>
    <p>Supports an end to end life cycle of model development</p>
    <p>and deployment</p>
    <p>Data scientists can easily launch data science tools like RStudio or Notebook and use libraries and run time of their</p>
    <p>choice to build the mining models</p>
    <p>Allows collaborative work on a machine learning project</p>
    <p>and have access to all project artifacts</p>

    <p>Problem Statement</p>
    <p>Less adoption of users to platform</p>
    <p>Based on the survey results, the major challenge was</p>
    <p>platform complexity</p>
    <p>It is hard to deduce actionable items or accurate details to</p>
    <p>make the system simple</p>
    <p>The complexity feedback was very generic, so we decided to break it down into two logical</p>
    <p>challenges: Education &amp; Training</p>
    <p>Simplicity-of-Platform</p>

    <p>Analyzer</p>
    <p>uses a user-behaviour-segregation-model and set of rules to evaluate challenges of using MLP</p>
    <p>The model uses clustering technique, which groups the users based on action and time signals</p>
    <p>Users in the group are labelled as: Beginner, Intermediate and Expert  Our model has suggested 85 Expert, 118 Intermediate and 190 Beginner users of our</p>
    <p>platform</p>

    <p>Rule Engine</p>
    <p>If more than 50% expert and 65% intermediate and 80% beginner users see the error signal then it is mapped to SoP challenge</p>
    <p>If less than 10% expert and more than 65% intermediate and 80% beginner users see the error signal then it is mapped to ET challenge</p>
    <p>If more than 50% expert does redundent actions more than 5 times in a week/month then it is mapped to SoP challenge</p>
    <p>If less than 10% expert and more than 50% intermediate and 75% does redundent actions more than 5 times in a week/month then it is mapped to ET challenge</p>
