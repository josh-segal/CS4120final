    <p>Data Protection and Sanitization</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>Human layers of the OSI networking model</p>
    <p>We discard all but the MAC layer.</p>
    <p>We encrypt every packet before sending it to the server.</p>
    <p>The server sanitizes every 802.11 frame header just after decryption.</p>
    <p>Sanitization key is generated anew for every experiment, using a random seed, which is discarded after use.</p>
    <p>Why sanitize on the server, not on the AMs?</p>
    <p>- Sanitization on AMs would be too CPU-intensive. - Sharing the sanitization key securely is hard.</p>

    <p>Some did not show concern.</p>
    <p>Librarians were sensitized due to new laws and afraid to upset various groups, in part due to their experiences with Patriot Act. In the end, trusted the researchers, relying on public announcements of DISTs activities.</p>
