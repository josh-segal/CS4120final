    <p>Position } Audit mechanisms are essential for privacy protection in</p>
    <p>healthcare environments } Guided by comprehensive study of HIPAA Privacy Rule</p>
    <p>(WPES10, CCS11)</p>
    <p>} Principled audit mechanisms based on machine learning and economics can be used to provide operational guidance to organizations on how to conduct audits } For grey policy concepts: was access for purpose of</p>
    <p>treatment or curiosity, financial gain etc.?</p>

    <p>Learning to Audit</p>
    <p>Auditing budget: $3000/ cycle Cost for one inspection: $100 Only 30 inspections per cycle</p>
    <p>Auditor</p>
    <p>Access divided into 2 types</p>
    <p>Loss from 1 violation (internal, external)</p>
    <p>$500, $1000</p>
    <p>$250, $500</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Audit Mechanism Choices</p>
    <p>Only 30 inspections</p>
    <p>Consider 4 possible allocations of the available 30 inspections</p>
    <p>Choose allocation probabilistically based on weights</p>

    <p>Regret Minimizing Audits } Learns from experience to recommend budget allocation</p>
    <p>for audit in each audit cycle } Observed loss used to estimate loss for each action and</p>
    <p>update probabilities for actions } Budget allocation is provably close to optimal fixed strategy</p>
    <p>in hindsight (e.g., budget allocation)</p>
    <p>} Technical approach: New regret minimization algorithm for repeated games of imperfect information</p>

    <p>Future Work } Alternative adversary models</p>
    <p>} Worst-case, rational, well-behaved</p>
    <p>} Alternative audit mechanisms } Incorporating incentives</p>
    <p>} Identifying experts } Can experts be learned from logs?</p>
