    <p>First big infec=on happened in Chinese networks in a rela=ve short period of =me. Look-ups from US networks reached 1,000 more than 20 days ajer the botnet was launched. Italy, Spain and India reached the 100 daily lookups 15 days later than the beginning of this botnet.</p>
    <p>The average lookup volume every day was 438,471 with the average de-duplicated query tuples in the range of 3,883. We observe that the daily growth of unique CIDRs, AS and CCs related to the RDNSs that queried the domain names used in the botnet followed the same padern.</p>

(174.139.97.122 ,98.126.115.90), SAUDINETSTC-AS (2.88.6.188), Take 2 Hos=ng (173.252.197.103), CHINANET-BACKBONE (118.123.12.6) Single MD5: 9f9aX. Detected December 2010, malware obtained on February 2011.</p>

    <p>Lenovo Botnet: Hosted in CHINANET-BACKBONE 61.183.44.0/23. Nine domain names were linked with C&amp;C ac=vi=es. ~1K infected hosts in the overall (358) infected networks with distribu=on: 98 VN, 85 US, 65 TW, 38 FR, 12 CN, etc. MD5 45f5X.

    <p>c0c1 Botnet (?) Discovery c0c1 Botnet: no MD5 yet. There are (poten=ally) ~15K infected IPs in 44 different coun=es. The IP per CC distribu=on for the first month was: 1324 CN, 661 TW, 238 KR, 223 US, 91 JP, 82 ES, 66 HK, 52 FR, 34 PL, 34 D, 21 VN, 20 BR etc.</p>
    <p>The (poten=al) 22 C&amp;Cs were hosted at AS30058 FDCSERVERS (US). The domains were suspended without any complaints. The botnet was iden=fied in August 2010.</p>

    <p>Malware is out there up to a couple of months before the security community finds a related MD5</p>
    <p>Contribu=ons of Kopis:  We can detect and stop a botnet while it is on the rise before the responsible malware is found</p>
    <p>We have the ability to measure and model key proper=es of malware domain names on the rise</p>
    <p>Independently deployable by network operators  Early warning: able to detect malware domains before the malware reaches your network!</p>
    <p>Low FPs and high TPs in almost all evalua=on modes</p>
