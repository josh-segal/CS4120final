    <p>Competitions as Recruitment Tools</p>
    <p>Cyber offense, defense or both</p>
    <p>+ Fun</p>
    <p>+ Engaging</p>
    <p>+ Group activity</p>
    <p>- Difficult</p>

    <p>ACM Tapia 2015</p>
    <p>ACM Richard Tapia Conferences  Celebrate diversity in computing</p>
    <p>Bring together undergrads, grads, faculty, researchers and professionals</p>
    <p>After-conference activities: university tours, industry visits, workshops</p>
    <p>Security workshop  Includes a hands-on activity like Capture-The-Flag</p>
    <p>Organized by UC Berkeley TRUST center since 2014</p>
    <p>No prerequisites to attend, required pre-registration</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Novices and Competitions</p>
    <p>Challenging</p>
    <p>Require background in networking and/or OS</p>
    <p>Require strong coding skills (scripting)</p>
    <p>Details matter</p>
    <p>Many strategies possible for attack/defense</p>
    <p>Teamwork is crucial</p>
    <p>Easy to get left behind</p>
    <p>Not ideal as a recruitment tool</p>
    <p>But fun, engaging, appeal to young people</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Class Capture-The-Flag</p>
    <p>Integrated with DeterLab http://www.deterlab.net</p>
    <p>Done after lectures and hands-on homeworks</p>
    <p>Experience adversarial thinking, internalize knowledge</p>
    <p>Feature CCTF</p>
    <p>Preparation A few weeks</p>
    <p>Duration 2 h</p>
    <p>Topic Intrusions, DDoS, DNS, BGP, crypto</p>
    <p>Team roles Both Blue and Red</p>
    <p>Occurrence 2-3 times per semester</p>
    <p>Difficulty Intermediate</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Resilient Server CCTF</p>
    <p>Red team floods the</p>
    <p>server node from two</p>
    <p>clients</p>
    <p>Targets the bottleneck</p>
    <p>link or the application,</p>
    <p>may spoof</p>
    <p>Blue team protects</p>
    <p>the server</p>
    <p>Filters at the server or</p>
    <p>at the gateway</p>
    <p>Doesnt know which</p>
    <p>one is the good client</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Resilient Server CCTF</p>
    <p>Score by legitimate clients experience</p>
    <p>Slow or no response  red teams point</p>
    <p>Fast response  blue teams point</p>
    <p>Why choose this exercise for the workshop?</p>
    <p>Easy phenomena to explain to novices</p>
    <p>Easy to perform the attack, just send lots of traffic</p>
    <p>Many options for attack/defense</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Adjustments for the Workshop</p>
    <p>Factor Adjustment Outcome</p>
    <p>Short prep Flooder and Slowloris tools provided</p>
    <p>Helped by introducing structure</p>
    <p>Short prep Mandatory Linux and DeterLab BoF Helped by instructional scaffolding</p>
    <p>Varied skills Balanced teams Helped somewhat (bias and low turnout)</p>
    <p>No background Background materials given before the workshop</p>
    <p>Helped somewhat (low adoption)</p>
    <p>No background Mentors with each team Helped by instructional scaffolding</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Competition Setup</p>
    <p>3 teams</p>
    <p>Each sub-divided into Blue group and Red group</p>
    <p>3 parallel competitions</p>
    <p>Team 3</p>
    <p>Team 1 Team 3</p>
    <p>Team 1</p>
    <p>Team 1</p>
    <p>Team 2 Team 1</p>
    <p>Team 2</p>
    <p>Team 2</p>
    <p>Team 3 Team 2</p>
    <p>Team 3</p>

    <p>Organizational Challenges</p>
    <p>Team rebalancing</p>
    <p>Some pre-registered students did not show up</p>
    <p>Students did not self-evaluate correctly</p>
    <p>One strong team, two weaker ones</p>
    <p>Background materials are useless</p>
    <p>A few students read them, missed details</p>
    <p>Assume self-learning but novices not good at it</p>
    <p>Mentors helped</p>
    <p>Mixed population</p>
    <p>Undergrads had harder time than grads</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Evaluating Learning/Engagement</p>
    <p>Pre- and post- questionnaire</p>
    <p>Using a modified UTRECHT-9</p>
    <p>Measured engagement (feeling happy, inspired, enthusiastic)</p>
    <p>Measured learning for specific tasks</p>
    <p>(e.g., I am confident I can develop monitoring software on the</p>
    <p>gateway machine that will let me automatically check if server</p>
    <p>is getting slow. )</p>
    <p>Only 5 matched pairs (out of 18 participants)</p>
    <p>Show increase in learning and engagement</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Roadmap</p>
    <p>Gamification!</p>
    <p>Balance teams by skills and seniority  Experience matters</p>
    <p>Advance collection of demographic/competence info  Use objective measures like quizzes</p>
    <p>Team building  Ice-breaker activities, mentors</p>
    <p>Event logistics  Reach all participants; bring new ones to speed</p>
    <p>Additional scaffolding and community building  Share knowledge with all teams, demo key activities</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Gamification</p>
    <p>A game with clear, easy rules</p>
    <p>Red team: launch or stop an attack  Flooding: UDP/TCP/ICMP, port 80 or random, spoof or not</p>
    <p>Application: Slowloris</p>
    <p>Blue team: place or remove a filter  At gateway: By protocol, port or IP</p>
    <p>At application: By conn. duration</p>
    <p>Tools for situational awareness</p>
    <p>Amount of attack and legitimate traffic reaching the</p>
    <p>server, breakdown by protocol, port and IP</p>
    <p>What is dropped by filter</p>
