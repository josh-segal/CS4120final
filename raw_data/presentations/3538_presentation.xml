    <p>Card skimming at gas stations is a significant problem</p>
    <p>Skimmers are found at gas stations across the U.S.  972 in Florida and 148 in Arizona in 2018</p>
    <p>50% increase from 2017</p>
    <p>Skimming is a lucrative business  30-100 cards per skimmer per day, $500 per card</p>
    <p>Estimated fraud in 2018: &gt; $16 million in one day Source: Arizona Weights and Measures</p>

    <p>It is difficult to find skimmers in gas pumps</p>
    <p>Finding skimmers is like finding a needle in a haystack  7,325 skimmer inspections in AZ (2016-18)</p>
    <p>Skimmers were found in only 1.5% inspections</p>
    <p>Common detection mechanisms are ineffective  E.g., Tamper-proof seals (Scaife et al., S&amp;P `19)</p>

    <p>Skimming devices are detectible in the sea of legitimate Bluetooth devices</p>
    <p>Bluetana allows inspectors to find skimmers faster than manual inspections</p>
    <p>Criminal behaviors make skimmers easier to find (and may even indicate their source)</p>
    <p>This problem is not going away any time soon (we found six skimmers in the Bay Area last week)</p>
