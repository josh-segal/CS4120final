    <p>Our design We build on this work with a mock-up that we tested with 7 couples (14 people) where we asked them to talk aloud as they chose safety settings</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What choice and support mean Logs reinforce autonomy (particularly around shared assets) and dual perspective</p>
    <p>More restrictions around shared assets</p>
    <p>Flexible, adaptive, and natural</p>
    <p>Social autonomy</p>
    <p>Embrace of uncertainty of memory loss</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Future work We are developing our next iteration to compliment participants view that the system is for both of them and helps them embrace uncertainty</p>
