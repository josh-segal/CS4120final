    <p>Example: long text Lets say you want to view and edit your preferences about the types of Google ads shown to you across the web. You might want to make sure that these ads reflect your interests. Or if you find personalized ads creepy, you could opt out of personalized ads. You can visit Ads Settings to set your preferences on the types of advertisements youd like to see. You can add a new interest. Even Google sites like YouTube, will provide ads related to your interests, which you can edit at any time. You can also opt out of Googles advertising services, resulting in any type of ads being shown. By opting out, you will no longer be able to edit your interests. Also, all advertising interests associated with your Google account will be deleted.</p>
