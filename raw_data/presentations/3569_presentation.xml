    <p>ABSTRACT Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) is a proprietary and un</p>
    <p>documented IEEE 802.11-based ad hoc protocol. Apple rst</p>
    <p>introduced AWDL around 2014 and has since integrated it</p>
    <p>into its entire product line, including iPhone and Mac. While</p>
    <p>we have found that AWDL drives popular applications such</p>
    <p>as AirPlay and AirDrop on more than one billion end-user</p>
    <p>devices, neither the protocol itself nor potential security and</p>
    <p>Wi-Fi coexistence issues have been studied. In this paper, we</p>
    <p>present the operation of the protocol as the result of binary</p>
    <p>and runtime analysis. In short, each AWDL node announces a</p>
    <p>sequence of Availability Windows (AWs) indicating its readi</p>
    <p>ness to communicate with other AWDL nodes. An elected</p>
    <p>master node synchronizes these sequences. Outside the AWs,</p>
    <p>nodes can tune their Wi-Fi radio to a dierent channel to</p>
    <p>communicate with an access point, or could turn it o to</p>
    <p>save energy. Based on our analysis, we conduct experiments</p>
    <p>to study the master election process, synchronization accu</p>
    <p>racy, channel hopping dynamics, and achievable throughput.</p>
    <p>We conduct a preliminary security assessment and publish</p>
    <p>an open source Wireshark dissector for AWDL to nourish</p>
    <p>future work.</p>

    <p>of Apples main product families such as Mac, iPhone, iPad,</p>
    <p>Apple Watch, and Apple TVeectively all recent Apple de</p>
    <p>vices containing a Wi-Fi chip. Apple does not advertise the</p>
    <p>protocol but only vaguely refers to it as a peer-to-peer Wi</p>
    <p>Fi technology [5, 6]. Yet, it empowers popular applications</p>
    <p>such as AirDrop and AirPlay that transparently use AWDL</p>
    <p>without the user noticing. We believe that public knowledge</p>
    <p>of this undocumented protocol would be benecial for the</p>
    <p>following reasons: First, since AWDL is based on IEEE 802.11,</p>
    <p>there are potential performance and co-existence issues that</p>
    <p>need to be identied. This is especially important in reg</p>
    <p>ulated environments as AWDL uses various channels and</p>
    <p>employs a channel hopping mechanism that might inter</p>
    <p>fere with corporate Wi-Fi deployments. Second, the Wi-Fi</p>
    <p>driver (where AWDL is implemented) is the largest binary</p>
    <p>kernel extension in current versions of macOS. Given the re</p>
    <p>cently published vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi chip rmware [7, 8]</p>
    <p>that might lead to full system compromise [9], we highly</p>
    <p>recommend a security audit of the protocol and its imple</p>
    <p>mentations as vulnerabilities in non-standardized protocols</p>
    <p>are even more likely to occur. For example, protocol fuzzing</p>
    <p>requires knowledge of the frame format. Third, an open</p>
    <p>re-implementation of the protocol would allow interoper</p>
    <p>ability with other operating systems, eventually enabling</p>
    <p>high-throughput cross-platform direct communication. Such</p>
    <p>technology is required, for example, in smartphone-based</p>
    <p>emergency communication applications [21, 25]. To maximize the impact for the research community, we</p>
    <p>have lifted a layer in Apples ecosystem and unveiled an 1Based on unit sales for iPhone, iPad, and Mac since 2014 [4].</p>
