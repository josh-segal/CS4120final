    <p>Background</p>
    <p>Heterogeneous information networks (HIN)  Networks containing multi-typed objects,</p>
    <p>interconnected via multi-typed relationships  Examples</p>
    <p>DBLP network: papers, authors, venues, terms  Flickr network: pictures, tags, users, groups</p>
    <p>Sources  From online web services: online shopping websites, social</p>
    <p>media websites, bibliographic websites,   From database systems: medical databases, university</p>
    <p>databases, police department databases,</p>

    <p>Similarity Search in HIN  For DBLP network (or other bibliographic networks)</p>
    <p>Find the most similar authors for a given author  Find the most similar venue for a given venue</p>

    <p>Meta Path Intuition Two objects can be connected via different connectivity paths E.g., two authors can be connected by author-paper-author (APA) author-paper-author-paper-author (APAPA) author-paper-venue-paper-author (APCPA)</p>
    <p>Each connectivity path represents a different semantic meaning and implies different similarity semantics</p>

    <p>Properties of PathSim</p>

    <p>Limiting behavior  If repeating a pattern of meta path infinite times, PathSim</p>
    <p>degenerates to authority ranking comparison</p>
    <p>Long meta path without introducing new relationships is not that helpful!</p>

    <p>The Top-K Similarity Search Problem under PathSim</p>
    <p>Given an HIN and its network schema , given a round trip meta path , where , the top-k similarity search problem under PathSim is:  for a query object , find the sorted k objects in the</p>
    <p>same type that are most similar to , under PathSim similarity definition</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Major Issues for Online Computation</p>
    <p>Very large matrix multiplication  Need to compute the commuting matrix</p>
    <p>Calculate from scratch?  Time expensive for online query processing</p>
    <p>Fully materialization?  Both time and space expensive</p>
    <p>E.g., for DBLP network (~710K authors), the meta path APCPA will generate around 5 billion nonzero elements, which needs storage up to 40 G; longer meta path will cost storage for 4T easily</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The Solution: Partial Materialization</p>
    <p>Partially materialize commuting matrices for short length meta paths, and concatenate them online to get longer ones for a given query  Materialize the commuting matrix for meta path ( for ):  Concatenate them into or online for a given query by vector</p>
    <p>matrix multiplication  The form of concatenation will be discussed in the following</p>
    <p>Two algorithms returning exact top-k results are proposed based on partial materialization  PathSim-baseline  PathSim-pruning</p>

    <p>Co-clustering-based Pruning Algorithm</p>
    <p>Intuition: prune the candidates that are not promising 1. Offline: Generate co-clusters according to partial commuting</p>
    <p>matrix and store statistics for each block for deriving upper bound of similarity</p>
    <p>Statistics include block sum, 1-norm and 2-norm for each row and column vectors</p>
    <p>candidate cluster; prune the whole cluster if it is not promising 2. Calculate the upper bound similarity between query and each</p>
    <p>candidate in the cluster; prune the candidate if it is not promising 3. Calculate the exact similarity measure between query and the</p>
    <p>candidate, and update the top-k list</p>

    <p>The Co-Clustering Algorithm on Parital Communting Matrix</p>
    <p>Input: Communting Matrix ; number of row clusters U; number of column clusters V</p>
    <p>Output: row clusters and column clusters  Iterative algorithm</p>
    <p>Fixing column clusters: get row centers and adjust row objects according to KL distance between row distribution and row cluster distribution</p>

    <p>Time Complexity Analysis for Online Query Processing</p>
    <p>SimRank  No exact computation for query-based similarity calculation  Full computation:</p>

    <p>P-PageRank  Query-based calculation:</p>
    <p>PathSim-baseline  Query-based calculation:</p>
    <p>n is the candidate objects and</p>
    <p>PathSim-pruning  Depends on the candidate sets  At most plus a much cheaper overhead to calculate upper bounds</p>

    <p>Similarity under Meta Path Combination</p>
    <p>The combined similarity is defined as a linear combination of PathSim under different meta paths  Experiment show that combined similarity can produce</p>
