    <p>I don't have any issue with hacked firm contacting them. It is probably the best thing to do. They can reset my password before anyone has a chance to try and hack my account.</p>
    <p>Global Inc has already failed in securing my data, and I do not trust them to make any efforts to secure my data elsewhere in the future.</p>
    <p>SCENARIO</p>

    <p>If John is a genuine researcher, then no problem. His work would benefit us in the long run.</p>
    <p>It's incredibly unethical for John to buy passwords from hackers. It's no different than someone buying a car that was stolen.</p>

    <p>Proactively reset passwords and</p>
    <p>lock down accounts from</p>
    <p>further damage</p>
    <p>This is a proactive step from [the company], and one that they are not actually obligated to do. This makes me feel like the company</p>
    <p>cares about protecting my identity</p>
    <p>I have faith that this action will</p>
    <p>ultimately contribute to making the general population less</p>
    <p>vulnerable in the long run.</p>
    <p>I think it's imperative for the company to tell the people whose data has been accessed. Companies should not control but rather empower</p>
