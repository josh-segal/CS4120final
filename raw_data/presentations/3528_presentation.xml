    <p>GPS Navigation: Billion Users  GPS navigation is widely used around the world</p>
    <p>Self-driving cars use GPS for navigation &amp; critical on-road decisions</p>
    <p>GPS malfunction can really lead to real-world consequences</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Known Threat: GPS Spoofing</p>
    <p>True location False location</p>
    <p>Civilian GPS is vulnerable to spoofing attacks due to the lack of authentication mechanisms</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>GPS Spoofing in Free Space In 2012, a drone was diverted in White Sands, New Mexico</p>
    <p>In 2013, a yacht was diverted on the way from Monaco to Greece</p>
    <p>Successfully diverted in open air/on open water</p>

    <p>Spoofing Road Navi: Challenging Real world Navigation map</p>
    <p>Turn left - physically impossible instruction!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges</p>
    <p>Random/nave manipulations do not work</p>
    <p>Cannot cope with road constraints, e.g., road shape, speed limit</p>
    <p>Create physically impossible routes</p>
    <p>Human driver in the loop</p>
    <p>Need to avoid alerting human drivers (stealthy)</p>
    <p>First to explore the feasibility of such attack</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What is the stealthy attack ?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Stealthy Attack Real world Navigation map</p>
    <p>Navigation instructions lead to attackers pre-defined location</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Concepts &amp; Core Idea Real world Navigation map</p>
    <p>Ghost location</p>
    <p>Original destination</p>
    <p>Actual location</p>
    <p>Ghost route Victim route</p>
    <p>Original route Assumption: know rough destination area or checkpoint</p>
    <p>Goal: find ghost route to mimic the shape of victim route</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Segment length matching Concatenate victim routes</p>
    <p>Route Searching Algorithm</p>
    <p>Map Directed</p>
    <p>Graph Exhaustive</p>
    <p>BFS Iterative</p>
    <p>searching</p>
    <p>Search ends whenever the attack goal is met</p>
    <p>Turn pattern matching</p>
    <p>Goal: find ghost route to mimic the shape of victim route</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Deviating: detour the victim with no specific target destination</p>
    <p>Targeted deviating: divert the victim to bypass a predefined location</p>
    <p>Endangering: divert the victim to dangerous situations like wrong-way driving on a highway</p>
    <p>Attack Consequences</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Trace-driven Simulation Results  600 real-world trips randomly selected from New York</p>
    <p>City and Boston taxi datasets  Run basic attack and iterative attack (two iterations)</p>
    <p>Deviating: on average, 335 and 3507 qualified victim routes per trip</p>
    <p>Endangering: 599 out of 600 (99.8%) contains wrong-way road segments</p>
    <p>A wide range of attack opportunities &amp; real danger</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Evaluation metric: hit rate</p>
    <p>How likely a pre-defined location is feasible</p>
    <p># diverted / # candidate</p>
    <p>Results: 70% median hit rate with 500m radius in Manhattan</p>
    <p>Targeted Deviating Results</p>
    <p>Original route</p>
    <p>Diverted grid Candidate grid Sweeping radius r Even random pre-defined locations are highly reachable</p>

    <p>Low-cost Portable GPS Spoofer ($223)</p>
    <p>Open-source hardware &amp; software</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Legal Permission &amp; Ethics  Experiments exclusively done in China with temporary legal</p>
    <p>permission from local authority and local IRB approval (#17-936)</p>
    <p>Controlled measurements at outdoor parking lot  After midnight with no one around</p>
    <p>Spoofing signals do not affect outside</p>
    <p>Real-world driving  After midnight with minimum traffic</p>
    <p>Min tx power (-40 dBm) + attenuators (-30 dBm) + car body shielding (-15 dBm) + two-meter propagation loss (-42.41 dBm) = not affected (-127.41 dBm)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Controlled Measurements</p>
    <p>Average takeover time: around 40 seconds</p>
    <p>Takeover distance: 40-50 meters  Consistent signal lock-on while driving</p>
    <p>Hide spoofer on the victim car Carry spoofer and tailgate the victim car</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Attack setup: same-car (no real users involved)</p>
    <p>One author drives a Ford Escape and strictly follows navigation instructions from Google Maps</p>
    <p>The other author attacks from the backseat</p>
    <p>Real-world Driving</p>
    <p>Trigger instructions in time and divert to 2.1 &amp; 2.5 km away</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Can human user detect it?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Let users drive in a simulator  They play truck drivers to deliver packages from location A to B</p>
    <p>See if they can be diverted without noticing the attack</p>
    <p>Users think this is for software usability testing</p>
    <p>Use software to spoof locations in real time  End it whenever the user recognizes the attack</p>
    <p>Complementary survey &amp; interview to know why they can/cannot detect the attack  Tell our real purpose and obtain their consent</p>
    <p>Realistic driving scenario</p>
    <p>User Study with Driving Simulator</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Key Results</p>
    <p>Attack success rate: 95% (38 out of 40)</p>
    <p>Two users detect it by cross-checking surrounding environment and navigation map to find inconsistency  Highway vs. local way</p>
    <p>Users are more likely to use GPS in unfamiliar areas</p>
    <p>Not enough pre-knowledge/time to check the inconsistency</p>
    <p>Most users experienced GPS malfunction in real life</p>
    <p>Unstable GPS signal does not alert users</p>

    <p>We explore the feasibility of stealthy manipulation of road navigation systems in three steps  Route searching algorithm, capability measurements &amp; real</p>
    <p>world driving, human-in-the-loop user study</p>
    <p>A potential defense inspired by the user study results  Using sensor fusion for cross-checking</p>
