    <p>Introduction  Modern distributed systems can</p>

    <p>Introduction  Edge Arrival Processes</p>
    <p>Let {n,i(t)} be an edge-arrival process from i to v  Mark processes Yic(n, t) if user i throws edges to node v</p>
    <p>The superposition n(t) = i=1n n,i(t) is the aggregate edge arrival process from the system to v  More in-coming links, more likely this node will be overloaded  More in-coming links, smaller isolation probability 5</p>

    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Previous work has analyzed numerous avenues for comprehending and improving decentralized systems  Graph connectivity [Gupta1998]  Resilience [Leonard2005, Yao2009]  Load balancing [Wang2007]  Routing mobility [Tshopp2008]  Improving capacity [Govindasamy2007]</p>
    <p>Prior studies rely on separate models  This field has reached sufficient maturity that calls for a</p>
    <p>unifying foundation for explaining the behavior of the aggregate edge process</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Related Existing Results  The Palm-Khintchine Theorem [Heyman1982] states that</p>
    <p>the superposition process converges to Poisson in distribution if  Each stationary renewal process is independent from any other</p>
    <p>process;  Each individual process becomes sparser as n increases; and  The aggregate arrival rate converges to a constant as n increases</p>
    <p>The Poisson approximation on the weakly dependent superposition of sparse point processes [Chen 2006]  The Poisson approximation is adequate if points exhibit a locally</p>
    <p>dependent structure</p>
    <p>Our work is rather different  Due to the intricate dependency that arises in space (co-existing</p>
    <p>nodes on the graph) and time (between different lifetimes) 7</p>

    <p>Modeling Assumptions</p>
    <p>Assumption 1 (user ON/OFF processes): 1) Given a fixed set of user types, the user ON/OFF durations of</p>
    <p>type j respectively follow CDFs F(j)(x) and G(j)(x) with finite means</p>
    <p>Assumption 2 (out-degree):  The number of outlinks ki each user i monitors is drawn from</p>

    <p>Proof Overview 3</p>
    <p>Intuitive thinking  Under Assumptions 1-2 and uniform selection, as n increase, the</p>
    <p>pool of available users for selection becomes larger  The probability that each user i selects any other peer more than</p>
    <p>once in [0, t] becomes smaller</p>
    <p>To bound the above probability, we first must show that moments of collection {Wi(n, t)}n&gt;1 exist for all n  Lemma 3 in the paper</p>
    <p>Currently, model is intractable under other neighbor selection strategies</p>
