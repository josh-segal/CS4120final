    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Argumentation is crucial in communication.  We want to avoid biased perception and uninformed decisions.</p>
    <p>Persuasion is complicated.  Being informative is already non-trivial, not to mention being persuasive.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Research Question</p>
    <p>How can we automate human argumentation process?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Our Goal  We generate a specific type of argument: counterargument.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Our Goal</p>
    <p>Input: a statement of belief on some controversial topic Output: a counterargument refuting the statement</p>
    <p>We generate a specific type of argument: counterargument.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Our Goal</p>
    <p>Input: Humans are not designed to be vegan. Output: We are not designed to be anything, evolution is directionless. You imply unnatural is bad, that is wrong. Driving and using smartphone are also unnatural.</p>

    <p>Automatic Evaluation  Topic Relevance</p>
    <p>Motivation: Generic arguments can still have high BLEU scores.  Topic relevance  Semantic similarity model [Huang et al, 2013]  Represents the semantic relatedness of two pieces of text  Model tuned on training set  Evaluated by mean reciprocal ranking (MRR) and Precision at 1 (P@1)</p>

    <p>Aspects (each on a scale of 1 to 5, the higher the better)  Grammaticality: if the output is fluent and grammatical English  Informativeness: whether the output is informative or generic  Relevance: it the output is on-topic and of correct stance</p>

    <p>- Human judges favor RETRIEVAL-BASED model in all aspects. - RETRIEVAL-BASED is human-written and relevant. - OUR MODEL is favored over SEQ2SEQ except Grammaticality.</p>

    <p>Sample Argument</p>
    <p>Putin is trying to re-form a Soviet Union with his past actions in Georgia and current actions in Ukraine.</p>
    <p>I firmly believe that Putin and the Russian Federation (RF) are trying to re-form a Soviet Union type regime The Russian Army invaded certain regions of Georgia</p>
    <p>There are two reasons you are so far beyond. There is no reason to see the military army. You can infer what they assume it, so they tend to protect up. There. If we assume it were bad, they can not be controlled. So were talking going to ignore the wars of the world. The fact of the matter is not bad. I would also assume it. However, the government can not be reminded of the world.</p>
