    <p>E-voting has been widely used worldwide</p>
    <p>Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Internet voting</p>
    <p>Local polling station voting using DRE 100% DRE usage in elections in India, Brazil</p>
    <p>Remote e-voting using Internet Estonia held the first national Internet election in 2007</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>However, e-voting is controversial</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Whats the future of e-voting?</p>
    <p>Will e-voting be more widely used? Or should it be abandoned?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Whats wrong with current e-voting deployment?</p>
    <p>They are unverifiable, working like a blackbox. Governments hoped to establish trust by certification. But it takes only one successful attack on a certified system to destroy the confidence.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>End-to-End (E2E) verifiable e-voting</p>
    <p>Lesson from the past: verifiability is important But that isnt anything new E2E verifiable e-voting has been known for over 20 years Many E2E systems proposed in the past So the problem solved?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>However, there is a gap between theory and practice</p>
    <p>Despite the extensive theoretical research on E2E, the practical impact has been limited.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Narrowing the gap - an engineering approach</p>
    <p>We take an engineering approach. The basic engineering principle: simplicity Keep everything as simple as possible, but not simpler Hence, we start by asking:</p>
    <p>Is the current E2E system as simple as it can be?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The state-of-the-art in E2E</p>
    <p>Basically the same as 20 years ago. All existing E2E schemes can be described by this architecture.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Where might be the problem?</p>
    <p>Existing E2E schemes require trustworthy Tallying Authorities. Our hypothesis: the TAs are a significant hurdle in deployment</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Case study: Helios-based UCL election</p>
    <p>Helios was used to elect the president of UCL in 2009. Tallying authorities presented one particularly difficult issue.</p>
    <p>Authorities were selected from university students/staff. But they knew little about crypto. They didnt know how to generate private keys. They didnt know how to distribute private keys. They didnt know how to store private keys. They didnt know how to create backup of private keys.</p>
    <p>Practical solutions Another group of experts did most of the actual work. Authorities were given the USB sticks with private keys. Meanwhile, all keys were backed up by a trusted third party.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>A motivating question for research</p>
    <p>Helios (and other E2E) requires a TA-based infrastructure Setting up such an infrastructure is a significant overhead</p>
    <p>Is this overhead always necessary?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>A new approach: self-enforcing electronic voting</p>
    <p>At first glance, it may look impossible: performing decryption without any decryption key However, it is actually possible. The basic intuition: canceling out random factors.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>A concrete protocol: DRE-i</p>
    <p>Direct Recording Electronic with Integrity (DRE-i) In this talk, we will focus on a local DRE-based election.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Phase 1: Setup (single-candidate example)</p>

    <p>+x 4</p>
    <p>x</p>
    <p>= 0.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Phase 2: Voting</p>
    <p>Receipt is coercion-free: because of the concealing property. Ballot casting assurance: due to the revealing property.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Phase 3: Tallying</p>
    <p>Ballot no i gxi gyi Published vote V i</p>
    <p>ZKPs</p>
    <p>n gxn gyn Dummy: gxnyn , gxnyn g Two 1-out-of-2 ZKP</p>
    <p>Anyone is able to compute V i</p>
    <p>= g xi yi gvi = g vi</p>
    <p>Note that x i</p>
    <p>y</p>
    <p>i</p>
    <p>= 0 (cancellation formula)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What if some ballots are missing?  A fail-safe mechanism</p>
    <p>Say a small subset L of ballots are found missing One trivial solution</p>
    <p>Re-publish gxi yi for i 2 L But this harms secrecy of individual ballots - leaks too much</p>
    <p>A better solution Publish A =</p>
    <p>i2L g x</p>
    <p>i</p>
    <p>y</p>
    <p>i (with ZKPs to prove A is well-formed) Minimum leakage: only the partial tally of missing ballots (assuming the attacker has the receipts of all missing ballots).</p>
