    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>Well describe the Linear A/Minoan digital corpus and the approaches we applied to develop it Why we should develop a Linear A Corpus and the reasons for which we chose XML-TEI EpiDoc Available resources and developing process The Linear A Corpus as Cultural Heritage</p>

    <p>Linear A and Minoan</p>
    <p>The Linear A script was used by the Minoan Civilization (Crete, 2500  1450 BC) and it still remains undeciphered Many symbols are shared by both Linear A and Linear B and are assumed to have phonetic values. The others are probably logograms:</p>
    <p>Linear A/B Linear A symbols 81 260</p>
    <p>value syllable logogram Linear B has been deciphered (during the 50s) and found to be used to write an Ancient Greek dialect, so many scholars are trying to decipher Linear A too</p>

    <p>Lack in digital resources</p>
    <p>After decades no deciphering attempts have been successful No heavy computational approaches have been attempted Only John G. Younger, in his website, provides a complete digital collection</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, it is stored in two simple HTML pages with not strict structure and transcribed as transliterations</p>
    <p>A new digital corpus in a suitable format and well organized may be a useful resource</p>

    <p>GORILA</p>
    <p>GORILA: Louis Godart and Jean-Pierre Olivier, Recueil des inscriptions en Linaire A GORILA contains</p>
    <p>a catalog of symbols/numeric codes  documents indexes with information about original place and type of</p>
    <p>support (these indexes were defined in the first place by Pope&amp;Raison)  indexed documents descriptions including pictures, drawings and</p>
    <p>handmade transcriptions</p>
    <p>the GORILA information is the standard point of reference: even recent collections always refer to the GORILA volume and page</p>

    <p>John G. Youngers website</p>
    <p>http://people.ku.edu/~jyounger/LinearA/ the website contains</p>
    <p>two HTML pages, one for Haghia Triadas documents, one for all the other places of origin</p>
    <p>1,077 transcriptions, with Linear B phonetics and GORILA code numbers (75.5% of the total amount of existing documents listed in GORILA)</p>
    <p>a conversion table: GORILA code numbers to syllables</p>

    <p>The Unicode set of characters for Linear A was released in June 2014 The 1,077 documents represented on Youngers website have been automatically converted</p>
    <p>from the syllable transcription (coexisting alongside GORILA code numbers for symbols not included in Linear B) to the full GORILA code numbers transcription</p>

    <p>Segmentation issues</p>
    <p>Separation is mainly indicated in two ways:  by isolating sign groups with numbers or logograms, thereby implying a</p>
    <p>separation  dots between sign groups, always used if there are long sign groups</p>
    <p>strings</p>
    <p>Example: This is a Linear A line:  is a number (it is assumed to be a number 5)  so and are assumed to be separated sign groups</p>

    <p>Corpus data format</p>
    <p>XML provides important advantages  metadata on several levels of annotation  elements and entities for unsupported glyphs or symbols</p>
    <p>EpiDoc is a TEI DTD with customization for Epigraphy  TEI-using community can provide support  a wide range of best-practice examples are available online</p>
    <p>The old Leiden system annotation task, familiar to epigraphers, is quite similar to the XML TEI EpiDoc annotation process</p>

    <p>Corpus size</p>
    <p>GORILA: 1,427 Linear A documents John G. Youngers website: 1,077 Linear A transcriptions (75.5% of the total) Our corpus will contain up to 1,077 Linear A XML TEI EpiDoc documents The Unicode conversions of John G. Youngers transcriptions have been converted in XML in an automatic way but the tagging has been only partially carried out The main remaing work (still in progress) is manually checking the data with the GORILA volumes</p>

    <p>John Younger ttf</p>
    <p>Before the release of Unicode 7.0, there was no way to visualize characters in the range 106001077F The traditional Linear A font, LA.ttf, included wrong Unicode positions We developed a new Linear A font, named after John Younger to show our appreciation for his work: John_Younger.ttf (available at http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/john-younger)</p>

    <p>From Linear A to Minoan culture</p>
    <p>The Linear A corpus is an important cultural monument, storing information about tradition, knowledge and lifestyle of Minoan people Even without a full understanding of transcriptions some cultural features can be inferred</p>
    <p>Economics and commerce: as some ideograms for basic commodities are similar to their Linear B counterparts, we can compare types and amounts of commodities</p>
    <p>Religion: there are around thirty libation formulas transcribed on various supports</p>
