    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>I Cloud computing important emerging area, with a spectrum of implementations</p>
    <p>I Thick cloud: Purchase a complete integrated service from a provider</p>
    <p>I Potentially greater efficiencies I Easier to set up</p>
    <p>I Thin cloud: Customer builds application on more generic services I More choices among service providers I Easier to migrate between providers I Potentially lower costs</p>
    <p>I Thin cloud offers some advantages, particularly for applications such as backup</p>
    <p>I How well can we do with such a simple interface?</p>
