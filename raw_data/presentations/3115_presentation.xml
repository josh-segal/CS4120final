  <div class="page">
    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Most commonly used datasets:  dated attacks  artificial in nature  trivial artifacts  dont represent the true nature of an attacker</p>
    <p>Network warfare games:  zero day attacks  potential for scalability  human driven interaction</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What is the Cyber Defense Exercise?  Annual network warfare competition  Numerous service academies (09 participants):</p>
    <p>United States Military Academy at West Point  Naval Post Graduate School  AFIT (2 teams)  United States Naval Academy  United States Air Force Academy  United States Merchant Marine Academy  United States Coast Guard Academy  Royal Canadian Military Academy</p>
    <p>Students must defend computer networks from constant attack  Attackers form the Red Cell  Red Cell comprised of National Security Agency and</p>
    <p>Department of Defense experts  Competition spans four days  Red Cell offensive operations authorized 9:00 am to 4:00 pm</p>

    <p>CDX 09 Network</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Example Captured Attack Vector</p>
    <p>[**] [119:18:1] (http_inspect) WEBROOT DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL [**]</p>
    <p>Types of Attacks (not exclusive):  Web Application Attacks  DNS Spoofing  Source Routing  Reverse Shells</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Logs from CDX 09</p>
    <p>Intrusion Detection Alert Database  DNS Service and Message Logs  Web Server Access and Error Logs  Splunk Logserver Aggregate Logs</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Benefits to our Approach</p>
    <p>Reduced artificiality  30 Red Cell personnel  20 White Cell personnel</p>
    <p>Scale of network  30 person team using entire class C network</p>
    <p>Aggregated logs from West Point competition network</p>

    <p>The Data</p>
    <p>Website with data and logs  http://www.itoc.usma.edu/research/dataset/</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Shortcomings to our Approach</p>
    <p>IDS Researchersmixture of cover traffic with malicious inhibits clearly labeled red traffic</p>
    <p>Lack of volume and diversity of traffic normally seen in production networks</p>
    <p>Length of CDX potential point of concern for anomaly detection that requires training period</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The Road Ahead</p>
    <p>West Point:  Increase number of capture sensors  Potential to provide actual virtual machines</p>
    <p>used during the exercise  Potential for observing worm behavior on</p>
    <p>exercise network  Potential for data capture on other</p>
    <p>network warfare games in near future</p>
