    <p>Problem of Black Domain Name List</p>
    <p>Blacklist does not cover all black domain</p>
    <p>names</p>
    <p>Numerous new bots are observed every day,</p>
    <p>thus we cannot capture all bots</p>
    <p>Some bots resolves many different black domain</p>
    <p>name , thus it is hard to maintain blacklist</p>
    <p>(e.g., Conficker worm)</p>

    <p>Objective of Study</p>
    <p>Extending blacklist</p>
    <p>Find unknown black domain names  Stop malicious activities by blocking connections from</p>
    <p>infected hosts to C&amp;C servers</p>
    <p>Using extended blacklist, find unknown</p>
    <p>infected hosts  Alert infected hosts to removing bot</p>
