    <p>Executive summary</p>
    <p>Problem: Unnecessary writebacks of cache files negatively impact performance and lifetime</p>
    <p>Most cache files in flash storage will not be read again before they are deleted</p>
    <p>Cache files are different at application-level, file-level, and read pattern-level</p>
    <p>Key idea</p>
    <p>FCFM: Fine-grain cache file management framework</p>
    <p>Total writes of cache files into flash storage in FCFM is 66% and 93% less than that of the fully-in-memory and fully-in-storage, respectively.</p>

    <p>Discussion Topics</p>
    <p>Topic 1: How to systematically categorize cache files.  Challenge: When a cache file is downloaded, the system does not know its exact characteristics.</p>
    <p>Topic 2: How much RAM should be used for in-memory file system.  There is a trade-off.</p>
    <p>Too small: not enough space to take advantage of FCFM.</p>
    <p>Too large: negatively impact other files.</p>
    <p>Topic 3: Cache file eviction scheme.  Problem: page-based evict scheme such as LRU is not suitable.</p>
