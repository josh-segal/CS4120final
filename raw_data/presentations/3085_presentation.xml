    <p>Share scientists understanding of a process with others  Guide the development of systems that implement scientists</p>

    <p>Phase1: Capture the vocabulary of the process in a Workflow-Driven Ontology (WDO)  WDOs have two main classes:</p>
    <p>Data, e.g., Gridded Dataset, Elevation Map  Method, e.g., Nearest-neighbor extrapolation</p>
    <p>Tool support to construct WDOs  Encoded in OWL  Reuse vocabulary from other OWL ontologies  Generate HTML reports</p>
    <p>Data is input to Method</p>

    <p>Phase2: Model the process as a Semantic Abstract Workflow (SAW)  Dataflow modeling  Graphical representation  Multiple levels of abstraction supported  Tool support to create SAWs</p>
    <p>Encoded in OWL  Generate HTML reports  Generate provenance-capturing modules</p>

    <p>Capturing Scientific Process Provenance  The framework:</p>
    <p>Process and Provenance ontology alignment  WDO: Identify things that can be used to document how</p>
    <p>things can happen (i.e., process)  PML-P: Identify things that can be used to document how</p>
    <p>things happened (i.e., provenance)</p>

    <p>Capturing Scientific Process Provenance  The framework:</p>
    <p>WDO reuses concepts from the PML-P ontology  WDO adds properties to the concepts from PML-P  WDO vocabulary can be used for Provenance queries!</p>
    <p>Vocabulary identified by scientist to document process</p>
    <p>Used to query provenance:</p>
    <p>Select NodeSets that have an antecedent of type GravityDataset</p>

    <p>Capturing Scientific Process Provenance  Automated scientific systems</p>
    <p>Use process knowledge to generate data annotator modules  Instrument system to call data annotators to record</p>
    <p>provenance during execution  E.g., C-shell scripts</p>
    <p>Use data annotators after system execution to construct provenance from logs/temp files generated by the system</p>
    <p>E.g., field data-gathering instruments with proprietary software and extensive logging features</p>

    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>Abstraction is used to comprehensively document scientific processes</p>
    <p>Encoding provenance in PML is not straight-forward, but tools can help</p>
    <p>Not all scientific processes are implemented as software systems</p>
    <p>This approach to document provenance may not be scalable for all systems, but it is useful for some:  Scientists building custom systems to gather data</p>
