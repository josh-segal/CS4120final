    <p>Figure: The utility achieved by the adaptive and fixed overhead controllers</p>
    <p>Our adaptive controller maintains the target utility UT very well along the entire streaming session</p>
    <p>However, fixed-overhead schemes cannot maintain high utility as packet loss varies</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>FEC has conflicting effects on video quality depending on the amount of overhead used</p>
    <p>Adaptive FEC overhead control can provide a high quality of video to end-users</p>
    <p>Proper control of FEC overhead can significantly improve the utility of received video over lossy channels</p>
