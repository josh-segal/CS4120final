    <p>Artificial Immune System (AIS)</p>
    <p>Inspired by biological immune systems Ability to adapt to variants and new pathogens Pattern matching for antibody and antigen binding</p>
    <p>AIS tries to distinguish self from non-self Self is normal traffic, non-self is abnormal traffic</p>
    <p>Uses several key biological features Negative selection Affinity maturation Immunization Peripheral tolerance</p>

    <p>Web Classifying Immune System (WCIS) Differences from Traditional AIS</p>
    <p>Add classifications to non-self patterns Enables specialization of sensors for specific areas Enables inoculation for specific attack class(es) Provides more information about zero-day attack than</p>
    <p>just an attack has been detected</p>
    <p>Separate evolutionary process from detection Do costly processes offline on back-end system Live traffic detection collects statistics to enable further</p>
    <p>refinement by back-end system</p>

    <p>WCIS  Request Parsing</p>
    <p>Pattern/chromosome structure Contains full set of request fingerprint features Flags indicate active/inactive features for sensor Each sensor has at least two active features</p>
    <p>Example: Length of 50-75 characters and 5-10 + characters</p>
    <p>Pattern matching Sensor compares active features to request Detects request as attack when sensor matches</p>
    <p>Must fall within range for ranged features Must match set bit for bitmap features Example: Length 65 with 7 + characters</p>

    <p>WCIS  Sensor Population Lifecycle</p>
    <p>Random generation of sensors Select features randomly &amp; initialize with random values</p>
    <p>Iterative affinity maturation Perform negative selection Test against attacks in populations classification Breed sensors with best affinity using genetic algorithm</p>
    <p>Single point crossover and rank selection with elitism Children feature selection based on union of parents active</p>
    <p>features and random active features from each parent</p>
    <p>Mutate subset of new sensors Select random feature and alter it</p>

    <p>WCIS  Sensor Population Lifecycle</p>
    <p>Deploy sensors on live environment Currently just test sensors against unlabeled data Record accuracy at detection and false positives Compare classification decisions by sensor populations</p>
    <p>Refine sensors in response to live detection Export statistical information to back-end system Enter a modified affinity maturation loop Code supports concept, but untested due to red tape</p>
    <p>Received clearance to test live deployment and refinement during this academic term</p>
