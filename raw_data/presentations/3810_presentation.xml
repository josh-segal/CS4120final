    <p>Do expiration policies help improve security?</p>
    <p>No evidence that expiration protects from modern password guessing attacks</p>
    <p>Attackers can use password history to launch better attacks (Zhang et al. CCS10)</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>I dont think [periodic password change] is as important as people say...A really strong password doesnt just</p>
    <p>automatically become weaker simply because youve been using it for a while.</p>
    <p>I dont believe its necessarily important to change your password, if you have a secure one in the first place</p>

    <p>Expiration frequency had minor impact on usage</p>

    <p>Slight influence on:  Password memorization</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>People accept the advice theyre told</p>
    <p>About 50% would continue changing their password if their expiration policy was removed</p>
    <p>Reported reasons:  Habit  Beneficial to security</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Its the standard we use and it works well.</p>
    <p>Its just a natural habit to do now for my own security.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>I would forget as it is not on my high priority list.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Expiration does not lead to weaker passwords or extremely negative reactions...</p>
    <p>...people have developed coping mechanisms which may not benefit account security as much as</p>
    <p>one would like</p>
    <p>BUT</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Main recommendation</p>
    <p>Enable users to create and manage complex passwords  Sufficiently random</p>
