    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>In todays Internet, we are witnessing the emergence of user-generated content in the form of photos, videos, news, customer reviews, and so forth.</p>
    <p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are able to offer a useful platform for sharing user-generated content, because P2P networks are self-organizing, distributed, inexpensive, scalable, and robust.</p>
    <p>However, it is well known that the free-riding phenomenon prevails in P2P networks, which hinders the effective utilization of P2P networks.</p>
    <p>We present a model of content production and sharing, and show that content pricing can be used to overcome the free-riding problem and achieve a socially optimal outcome, based on the principles of economics.</p>

    <p>Existing Work</p>
    <p>Existing Work</p>
    <p>Golle et al. (2001) construct a game theoretic model and propose a micro-payment mechanism to provide an incentive for sharing.</p>
    <p>Antoniadis et al. (2004) compare different pricing schemes and their informational requirements in the context of a simple file-sharing game.</p>
    <p>Adler et al. (2004) investigate the problem of selecting multiple server peers given the prices of service and a budget constraint.</p>
    <p>However, the models of the above papers capture only a partial picture of a content production and sharing scenario.</p>
    <p>In Park and van der Schaar (2010), we have proposed a game-theoretic model in which peers make production, sharing, and download decisions over three stages.</p>

    <p>Model</p>
    <p>We consider a P2P network consisting of N peers, which produce content using their own production technologies and distribute produced content using the P2P network.</p>
    <p>N , {1, . . . ,N}: set of peers in the P2P network D(i): set of peers that peer i can download from</p>
    <p>U(i): set of peers that peer i can upload to</p>
    <p>We model content production and sharing in the P2P network as a three-stage sequential game, called the content production and sharing (CPS) game.</p>

    <p>Allocation and Payoff</p>
    <p>Allocation of the CPS Game</p>
    <p>An allocation of the CPS game is represented by (x,y,Z), where x , (x1, . . . ,xN ), y , (y1, . . . ,yN ), zi , (zij )jD(i), for each i N , and Z , (z1, . . . ,zN ).</p>
    <p>An allocation (x,y,Z) is feasible if xi  0, 0  yi  xi , and 0  zij  yj for all j  D(i), for all i N .</p>

    <p>The payoff function of peer i in the CPS game is given by</p>

    <p>Nash Equilibrium and Social Optimum</p>
    <p>Nash Equilibrium</p>
    <p>A strategy for peer i in the CPS game is its complete contingent plan over the three stages, which can be represented by (xi,yi (xi ),zi (xi,yi, (yj )jD(i))).</p>
    <p>Nash equilibrium (NE) of the CPS game is defined as a strategy profile such that no peer can improve its payoff by a unilateral deviation.</p>
    <p>The play on the equilibrium path (i.e., the realized allocation) at an NE is called an NE outcome of the CPS game.</p>
    <p>NE of the CPS game can be used to predict the outcome when peers behave selfishly.</p>

    <p>Nash Equilibrium</p>
    <p>Proposition</p>
    <p>Suppose that, for each i N , a solution to maxx0{fi (x, 0) ki (x)} exists, and denote it as xei . An NE outcome of the CPS game has xi = x</p>
    <p>e i</p>
    <p>and zij = 0 for all j  D(i), for all i N .</p>
    <p>Idea of the Proof</p>
    <p>If zij &gt; 0 for some i N and j  D(i), peer j can increase its payoff by deviating to yj = 0. Therefore, zij = 0 for all i N and j  D(i) at any NE outcome. Given that there is no transfer of content, peers choose an autarkic optimal level of production.</p>
    <p>This result shows that without an incentive scheme, there is no utilization of the P2P network by selfish peers.</p>

    <p>Nash Equilibrium and Social Optimum</p>
    <p>Social Optimum</p>
    <p>We measure social welfare by the sum of the payoffs of peers,N i=1 vi (x,y,Z).</p>
    <p>A socially optimal (SO) allocation is an allocation that maximizes social welfare among feasible allocations.</p>
    <p>Using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we can characterize SO allocations.</p>

    <p>Content Pricing</p>
    <p>Pricing Scheme</p>
    <p>We introduce a pricing scheme in the CPS game as a potential solution to overcome the free-riding problem.</p>
    <p>pij : unit price of content that peer j provides to peer i.</p>
    <p>A pricing scheme can be represented by p , (pij )iN ,jD(i).</p>
    <p>The payoff function of peer i in the CPS game with pricing scheme p is given by</p>
    <p>i (x,y,Z; p) = vi (x,y,Z)</p>

    <p>(pij + ij )zij +</p>
    <p>jU(i)</p>
    <p>(pji ji )zji.</p>
    <p>Note that the introduction of a pricing scheme does not affect SO allocations.</p>

    <p>Content Pricing</p>
    <p>Proposition</p>
    <p>Let (x,y,Z) be an SO allocation and (ij )iN ,jD(i) be associated constants satisfying the KKT conditions (1)(5). Then (x,y,Z) is an NE outcome of the CPS game with pricing scheme p = (pij )iN ,jD(i), where pij = ij + ij for i N and j  D(i).</p>
    <p>In the expression pij = ij + ij , we can see that peer i compensates peer j for the upload cost, ij , as well as the shadow price, ij , of content supplied from peer j to peer i.</p>
    <p>The above proposition resembles the second fundamental theorem of welfare economics. However, our model is different from the general equilibrium model in that we consider networked interactions where the set of feasible consumption bundles for a peer depends on the sharing levels of peers from which it can download.</p>

    <p>1 = N = ( +  + )/2 and i =  for all i 6= 1,N. Since peers in the end (peers 1 and N) are less cost-efficient than peers in the middle (peers 2 through N  1), it is not SO to have peers in the end produce a positive amount of content.</p>
    <p>The structure of SO allocations depends on N.</p>
    <p>The optimal pricing scheme has peer-dependent prices, where the price that peer i pays to its neighboring peers is given by pi = g</p>
    <p>(ci ) , where c  i is the consumption of peer i at the SO</p>
    <p>allocation.</p>
