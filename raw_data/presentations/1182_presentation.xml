    <p>Why Do Online Tuning of NoSQL Databases?  Database Management Systems (DBMS) have a plethora</p>
    <p>of performance-related parameters  The exact setting of these parameters determines the</p>
    <p>DBMS performance  The optimal setting is specific to the application  Application characteristics change over time and a</p>
    <p>desirable configuration may become sub-optimal</p>
    <p>Our Target: Clustered NoSQL Databases (Examples: Cassandra, Redis, MongoDB, ScyllaDB)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Challenges of Online Tuning 1. Large configuration parameter search space.</p>
    <p>Complex interdependencies exist among the parameters 2. A new workload pattern does not necessarily mean</p>
    <p>switch to new configuration  Performance degradation during reconfiguration process  New workload pattern may be shortlived</p>
    <p>Many parameters need server restart  Staggered restart of servers needed through a distributed</p>
    <p>protocol to meet availability and consistency requirements</p>
  </div>

    <p>Look Before You Leap Change</p>
    <p>The default configuration can be switched to a read-optimized one for increase in throughput (40Kops/s  50Kops/s)</p>
    <p>Temporary throughput loss due to transient unavailability of server instances as they undergo reconfiguration, one instance at a time</p>
    <p>The dashed line gives the gain over time in terms of the total # operations served relative to the default configuration</p>
    <p>There is a cross-over point such that if the new workload pattern lasts greater than this threshold then it is worthwhile reconfiguring</p>

    <p>Technical Contributions: SOPHIA 1. We show that todays state-of-the-art static tuners degrade</p>
    <p>throughput below the default configuration and degrade data availability</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Evaluation  We implement and evaluate SOPHIA on two NoSQL</p>
    <p>databases, Cassandra and Redis  We use three application traces:</p>
    <p>We show improvements over 1. Default configuration 2. Static optimized 3. Nave reconfiguration 4. Commercial auto-tuning NoSQL database (ScyllaDB)</p>
