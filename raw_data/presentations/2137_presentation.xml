    <p>Traditional Personal Data Storage</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>From Physical Devices to Cloud</p>
    <p>! Widely used &quot; Accessible everywhere &quot; Trouble-free storage</p>
    <p>! Not yet fully adopted &quot; Cost &quot; No reliability guarantee</p>

    <p>Current Services: Cost and Liability</p>

    <p>As-is or best-effort services  Provider makes reasonable effort to avoid data loss  But has no liability to the fullest extent permi*ed by law</p>
    <p>$100/3TB</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Conservative Both Ways</p>
    <p>! Lots of copies exist &quot; Lose data, lose customer &quot; Cost included in service</p>
    <p>! Still no promise against loss</p>
    <p>! Case study: Amazon S3 storage &quot; Explicit availability guarantee</p>
    <p># Standard: 11 nines, $0.9/GB/Y $ 0.000000001% annual object loss rate</p>
    <p># RR (Reduced Redundancy): 4 nines, $0.72/GB/Y</p>

    <p>Insurance for data stored in cloud?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Common Hazards for Cloud Storage</p>
    <p>! Typically include &quot; Hazards causing data loss/corruption</p>
    <p># Storage hardware failures # Security attacks # Incorrect handling: human errors, software bugs # Environmental damage: building corruption/fire # Natural disasters: earthquake, flood, storm, wild fire</p>
    <p>&quot; Fraudulent claims from customers # Moral hazard</p>
    <p>&quot; Termination of business</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Data Loss Insurance: Rationale</p>
    <p>! Unique advantages of data insurance &quot; Service providers can actively reduce risks</p>
    <p># By making more copies # Any copy of data as good as original # Cost of extra copy much lower than value</p>
    <p>&quot; May reduce baseline replication aggressiveness # From 11 nines to 4 nines or even 2 nines</p>
    <p>! Optional to user &quot; Baseline service charge reduced for all</p>
    <p># Attract more paying customers</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Proposal: Optional Data Insurance</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Proof of Loss</p>
    <p>! Data receipt containing &quot; Traditional metadata</p>
    <p># Date # Dataset size</p>
    <p>&quot; Hash value # Pre-image attack impractical # Challenge compounded by</p>
    <p>using two hash algorithms</p>
    <p>Data size: 64MB Insurance amount: $3,000.00 Hash value list 1: Hash value list 2:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Premium Estimate ! Traditional formula for premium calucation</p>
    <p>&quot; P = L + U + E # P: premium # L: expected loss # U: underwriting expense # E: profit</p>
    <p>! Annual data loss insurance premium &quot; p = fbase f r v + cdisk r</p>
    <p># fbase : baseline availability (annual object loss rate) # f : annual disk failure raPo, aggressively esPmated as 0.1 [2] # r : replicaPon degree # v : declared data value ($/MB) # cdisk : disk price ($/MB), set to $100/2TB</p>
    <p>IndemnificaPon Cost of extra copies</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Sample Premiums: v = $10,000/MB</p>
    <p>! Observations on p-v (premium/insured-value) ratio &quot; Highest number matching shipping industry</p>
    <p># With baseline availability of 0.1 and one extra copy &quot; Declines when growing r or fbase &quot; Indemnification dominates</p>
    <p># With claimed value significantly larger than storage cost # Till replication degree and/or baseline availability large enough</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Miscellaneous Issues</p>
    <p>! Discontinued storage service &quot; Long-term trust required &quot; Possible solution: third-party insurers (reinsurance)</p>
    <p>! Access pattern aware optimizations &quot; Precious objects tend to be read-only</p>
    <p># May help lower risk and cost</p>
    <p>! Going beyond personal data &quot; Risks and liabilities more complicated for business data &quot; Techniques in business risk management applicable</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Closing Remarks ! Data insurance might make cloud storage (appear)</p>
    <p>safer and cheaper &quot; Psychological security for customers &quot; Reduced baseline redundancy for providers</p>
    <p>! Users explicitly marking important data &quot; Implicitly, unimportant data</p>
    <p>! Requires cross-discipline investigation &quot; Computer systems &quot; Cnsumer behavior study &quot; Actuarial science &quot; Law</p>
