    <p>The mobile money revolution</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Mobile money achievements</p>
    <p>Brought banking services to hundreds of millions who didnt have them Built mechanisms for direct payments and remittances; store of value; personal safety; transaction history; access to credit Provided direct channel for government payments Connected lots of people to the online world</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>What are the remaining challenges?</p>
    <p>Extend payments to areas with no mobile service (mountains, deserts, islands) Make service still work when network service intermittent (congestion, power cuts) Cut network charges / transaction fees Establish standards and interoperability for international remittances</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The DigiTally project</p>
    <p>The Gates Foundation asked for ideas to increase merchant use of mobile money We talked to operators and users in several countries: issues were network access and costs So: how can you do a payment between two phones when theres no GSM signal?  Its easy with two smartphones, but what about basic handsets (feature phones)?</p>

    <p>DigiTally overview</p>
    <p>DigiTally is a prototype system weve built to do research on offline mobile payments Address financial inclusion challenges in developing countries  It works by copying short authentication codes from one phone to another  It can also be implemented in SIM toolkit or as a smartphone app</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Overlay SIMs  Tamper-resistant SIM  Sticks on top of the regular SIM  Bypasses the mobile network operator  Independent secure device, like SE in NFC  Can be used to compute authorization codes, just as in EMV</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>DigiTally design</p>
    <p>Work in existing environments Do not require/introduce unfamiliar hardware Minimize assumption about constrained devices Focus on feature phones Mimic existing mobile payment systems Work seamlessly alongside any existing SIM card</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>DigiTally payment (I)</p>
    <p>Bob enters the amount, Ksh 450 on his phone  It shows an 8-digit authorization request, say 8972 0307 which he reads to Alice  She taps Ksh 450 and 8972 0307 on her phone  If they agree on the two phone numbers and the amount, then Alices phone proceeds to the next stage</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>DigiTally payment (II)</p>
    <p>Alices phone displays an 8-digit authorization response, say 7021 0003, which she reads to Bob  He taps in the code  If its correct, his phone displays Ksh 450 received with a log of the transaction (Alice gets a similar log)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Preliminary study (I)</p>
    <p>Collaborate with Strathmore University (Nairobi, Kenya)  19 participants at Strathmore University  Duration: 5 days  Loaded balance for student phones with Ksh 2000 (about $19.50)  Three outlets: Coffee shop (one till, quiet), Bookshop (two tills, bursty traffic), Cafeteria (five tills, madly busy at mealtimes)</p>

    <p>Preliminary study (II)</p>
    <p>Data collected: Error rates (code-entry errors, and wrong PIN input) Number of transactions Number of attempts to unlock the SIM Total amounts for all transactions (spent and received) Transaction duration times</p>

    <p>Results (System Usability Scale)</p>
    <p>All participants: the average SUS score for DigiTally was 78.8 (Good; B+ grade) Eight participants gave the equivalent of an A+ grade Merchant participants: the average SUS score was 71.4 (Good; C+ grade) Student participants: the average SUS score was 83.1 (Excellent; A grade)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Final remarks</p>
    <p>Our goal was to investigate usability problems for offline payments, and user requirements for development projects  DigiTally participants' experience was generally positive (perceived security, speed, deterministic, no network req.)  Research direction: rethink (reintroduce) resilience in critical systems, learn from delay-tolerant networks (DTNs), etc.  Focus on the bottom billion and the effects of unreliable networks and constrained tech on security and usability</p>
