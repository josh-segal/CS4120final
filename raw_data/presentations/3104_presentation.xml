    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Understand the workload of an entire family of drives  Salient characteristics across a set of applications that are targeted</p>
    <p>by a drive family</p>
    <p>Measurement on single systems (either operational or experimental) may be difficult to generalize over the entire usage scenarios for a drive family</p>
    <p>Complement the analysis obtained from detailed measurements in system with coarse grain information obtained over a larger set of drives</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Data Source  Drives returned back to Seagate</p>
    <p>Enterprise-level drives  Cheetah 10K RPM  Cheetah 15K RPM</p>
    <p>Upon return drives go through the Field Return Incoming Test  Extracts information from drives  It may not be possible if the drive is failed</p>
    <p>Information consists of cumulative attributes</p>
    <p>Attributes analyzed in this paper  Power-on hours  Spin-ups  Bytes READ  Bytes WRITTEN  SEEKs</p>

    <p>Available drives per family</p>
    <p>Drives are grouped based on the family (10K or 15K)  Although used in enterprise systems the set of applications and</p>
    <p>reliability and performance requirements are expected to be different for the two families</p>
    <p>Drives are also distinguished by their lifetime  Drives less than a month are expected to have experience only</p>
    <p>integration activity  Drives more than a month are expected to have experienced both</p>
    <p>integration and normal in-field operation  More information about how drives are used in the field from the</p>
    <p>applications they support</p>
    <p>Drive Family Total drives Less than 1 month More than 1 month Cheetah 10K 197,013 43,999 153,014 Cheetah 15K 108,649 19,557 89,092</p>

    <p>Advantages of the data set</p>
    <p>A large set of available drives  Thousands of drives</p>
    <p>Drives in the field integrated in the entire spectrum of storage systems  Each type of storage system is represented accordingly to its</p>
    <p>popularity in the set</p>
    <p>We expected to capture correctly the dynamics across the entire spectrum of applications supported by a given drive family</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Drawbacks of the data set</p>
    <p>Granularity of the information in the data set  One cumulative number per attribute  Only average behavior  Dynamics of workload behavior over time is not available here</p>
    <p>The data set comes from drives returned because of issues  The selection of the set is not random and may be biased  Drives with issues may experience heavier load than other</p>
    <p>drives  We have evaluated here only drives whose data is still</p>
    <p>accessible (severity of the problem is low)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Power-On hours of the drives</p>
    <p>In our set there is a wide range of drives  From drives with a few months of life to drives that have been</p>
    <p>in the field for about three years  The drive families we analyze have been in the field for at most 3</p>
    <p>years  50% of drives more than a year in the field</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Powering up/down the drives  Distribution of the number of Spin-ups per month is significantly</p>
    <p>different in drives more than a month old and less than a month old  During integration drives go through more intense operation  During normal operation drives almost never get shutdown</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Bytes READ/WRITTEN  10K RPM  Distribution of Mbytes READ/WRITTEN per hour  Variability much higher during integration  More stability during normal operation  Median at 15-20 MB per hour</p>
    <p>Drives lightly utilized, 3% more than 1GB per hour throughout lifetime  Except integration, READs/WRITEs behave similarly</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Bytes READ/WRITTEN  15K RPM  Distribution of Mbytes READ/WRITTEN per hour  Less difference between two age-based categories than in 10K RPM</p>
    <p>drives  READs/WRITEs behave similarly  Slightly more work than 10K RPM drives</p>
    <p>5% of drives transfer more than 1GB of data per hour</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Bytes READ/WRITTEN by capacity - 10K RPM</p>
    <p>Each drive family has three capacities and we further categorize our drives based on their capacity</p>
    <p>There is almost no difference in the amount of bytes written  There is difference in the amount of bytes read</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Bytes READ/WRITTEN by capacity  15K RPM</p>
    <p>Each drive family has three capacities and we further categorize our drives based on their capacity</p>
    <p>There is almost no difference in the amount of bytes written  There is difference in the amount of bytes read</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>READ/WRITE ratio  We estimate the portion of bytes READs in the total bytes transferred  In 10K RPM drives there is more writing during integration which means</p>
    <p>that their data is stored in the beginning and accessed afterwards  This is not the case for 15K RPM drives</p>
    <p>More drives seem to WRITE more than they READ  This is very significant when it comes to the special handling of the</p>
    <p>WRITE traffic throughout the IO path</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Distribution of Seeks  Among the available information is the cumulative number of seeks  Estimate the average number of seeks per second  15K RMP complete more seeks than 10K RPM drives in average</p>
    <p>30 seeks per second vs. 40 seeks per seconds  A seek takes in average a few (2-3) ms</p>
    <p>5-10% of drives with about 70-100 seeks per second which represents the portion of drives experiencing consistent high utilization throughout their life</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>Information extracted from the returned drives is used to characterize workloads processed by an entire drive family</p>
    <p>During the Field Return Incoming Test, the number of spinups, amount of bytes READ and WRITTEN, and the amount of SEEKS over the entire lifetime of a drive were analyzed</p>
    <p>Workload variability across drives is high in particular during the early life (integration) of the drive</p>
    <p>Drives are generally underutilized with about 10% of them experiencing utilizations that would affect the availability of idleness available to complete activities that enhance reliability, performance, and power consumption</p>
    <p>The majority of drives WRITE more than they READ</p>
