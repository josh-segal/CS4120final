    <p>Whats new here?</p>
    <p>Way to audit that:</p>
    <p>Has a big chance of correcting the outcome if the outcome is wrong (risk-limiting).</p>
    <p>Enables the public to have strong evidence that the outcome is right, without having to trust (many) others.</p>
    <p>Preserves voter privacy.  Is efficient, affordable, and currently feasible.</p>

    <p>Motivation  Risk-limiting audits now widely considered best practice.  Auditing individual ballots requires least counting.  Auditing individual ballots increases transparency.  Simultaneously auditing all contests on each selected ballot can</p>
    <p>increase efficiency.  Publishing data at the ballot level can compromise voter privacy.  But if the raw data arent published, public might not trust the</p>
    <p>results or the audit.  Can we keep the benefits of simultaneous auditing at the ballot</p>
    <p>level and have data transparency without compromising privacy?</p>
    <p>E2E could do it, but requires changes, heavy crypto, critical mass of voters.</p>
    <p>Is there a bolt-on solution that doesnt require much change to voting systems or procedures, and that relies less on mathy stuff?</p>
