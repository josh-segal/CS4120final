    <p>Storage Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Common in the cloud:</p>
    <p>Does not happen in HDD storage racks:</p>

    <p>Strict HDD Ownership Principle:</p>
    <p>HDD always managed by the server to which it is physically attached</p>

    <p>Rack-Scale HDD Storage Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Relaxing the HDD Ownership Principle  At a given time, a HDD is managed by one server</p>
    <p>but it is possible to reconfigure which server it is.</p>
    <p>Enables 4 types of disaggregation:  Configuration Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Failure Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Dynamic Elastic Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Complete Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Storage Fabric No reconfiguration during normal operation</p>
    <p>Reconfiguration part of normal operation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>No Reconfiguration during Normal Operation</p>
    <p>Configuration Disaggregation  One rack for all workloads</p>
    <p>Configure once at deployment</p>
    <p>Optimized offline for workload</p>
    <p>Failure Disaggregation  Reconfigure on server failure</p>
    <p>Move HDDs, not data</p>
    <p>General purpose storage rack</p>
    <p>Failover</p>
    <p>Failed server</p>
    <p>Customized rack layout</p>
    <p>Deploy as regular storage</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Reconfiguration is part of Normal Operation</p>
    <p>Dynamic Elastic Disaggregation  Dynamically adapt HDD-to-server ratio</p>
    <p>High load: each server gets its fair share of HDDs</p>
    <p>Low load: most HDDs attached to few servers</p>
    <p>Complete Disaggregation  Reconfigure at IO granularity</p>
    <p>Any server can IO to any file on any HDD</p>

    <p>A Fabric to Explore Rack-Scale Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Storage switch  Custom hardware design</p>
    <p>Circuit switch abstraction</p>
    <p>160 ports @ 6 Gbps/port</p>
    <p>Benefit of the design: extreme flexibility</p>
    <p>Crosspoint ASIC  Circuits between any port pairs  Electrical signal forwarding</p>
    <p>Microcontroller  circuit management</p>
    <p>SAS Enclosure</p>
    <p>SATA HBA</p>

    <p>Experience with Configuration Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Easy to enable  No controller</p>
    <p>No reconfiguration overhead</p>
    <p>Unmodified software on servers</p>
    <p>Simplifies management &amp; operation  One storage rack for all workloads</p>
    <p>Our test setup for configuration disaggregation</p>
    <p>Also very useful for development  We use it on a daily basis!</p>
    <p>Fast instantiation of test configurations</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Experience with Failure Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Hardware trends impact data availability:  HDD and SSD capacities grow</p>
    <p>Servers can have a LOT of direct-attached storage</p>
    <p>e.g.: Petabytes of data per Pelican (cold storage) server</p>
    <p>On failure, amount of data and time to recover increases</p>
    <p>Pelican prototype has:  1152 HDDs/rack  2 servers</p>
    <p>Failure disaggregation improves availability  Reduces data unavailability to tens of seconds or less</p>
    <p>No resources used to rebuild data</p>
    <p>No reconfiguration overhead for normal operation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Exploring Dynamic Elastic Disaggregation</p>
    <p>Ongoing work</p>
    <p>Storage workloads are bursty  Average server utilization is low  Load skew across servers</p>
    <p>Online controller  Monitors storage traffic in the rack  Adapts HDD-to-server ratio  Not on the data path</p>
    <p>Better server utilization  Allows storage tiering within the rack  Some servers can host background jobs, spot VM instances</p>

    <p>Experience with Complete Disaggregation</p>
    <p>A lot of pain:  Ecosystem challenges</p>
    <p>Redesign of the storage stack</p>
    <p>High overhead for small IO</p>
    <p>Meta data service on the IO path</p>
    <p>Hard to implement/debug</p>
    <p>Benefits  Fine-grain load balancing</p>
    <p>Server failure tolerance by design Complete disaggregation setup  120 SATA SSDs  4 servers, 3 SATA ports/server</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>In the cloud today: no disaggregation in storage racks  Fixed drive-to-server mapping</p>
    <p>Substantial benefits  No/small reconfiguration overheads  Little or no software/hardware changes</p>
    <p>High reconfiguration overhead  Hard to implement and maintain</p>
    <p>We designed a storage fabric to explore in-rack disaggregation</p>
    <p>Rack-scale storage disaggregation can be useful and affordable  Configuration disaggregation</p>
