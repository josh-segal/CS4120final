    <p>In Computer Science?</p>
    <p>Increasing the frequency of measurement can decrease the number of concurrent containers we can utilize without interfering with the performance of the experiment itself.</p>
    <p>When testbeds scale up to hundreds of lightweight containers</p>
    <p>how system resources managed</p>
    <p>how the containers interact with each other</p>
    <p>Is the fidelity maintained</p>

    <p>Contribution and Limitation</p>
    <p>First time unveiled uncertainty problem due to system resource contention in a lightweight virtualization environment</p>
    <p>The desirable accuracy of measurement is largely dependent on the high sampling frequency, which potentially deprives the containers of available resources and adversely interferes with the experiment</p>
    <p>No quantitive analysis or formula yet</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Virtualization has some limitations due the sharing of host resources (CPU, network, memory and disk) among same host VEEs</p>
    <p>The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for host resource measurements: increasing the precision and fidelity of the resource measurements can interfere with the behavior of the experiment</p>
    <p>It is not a trivial task to determine the maximum number of VEEs that can be run concurrently in a physical machine without perturbing the experimental outcome</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Future Vision</p>
    <p>More experiments to delve deeper and investigate the kernel data structures to achieve fine-grained resource management</p>
    <p>Modeling the host environment, guide the implementation of virtualization</p>
