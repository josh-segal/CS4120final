    <p>Key Takeaways  Robocalling is a major security issue in the United</p>
    <p>State. We desperately need effective solutions to combat robocalls and protect phone users</p>
    <p>Even though we suggest users to be cautious when answering calls from unknown numbers, answering a robocall does not necessarily increase the number of robocalls</p>
    <p>Illegal robocalls are highly targeted. They regularly spoof caller ID or rotate between numbers and perform neighbor spoofing to entice victims</p>
    <p>Fraudulent robocalls can operate for long durations without being detected. They are designed to target vulnerable population</p>
