    <p>Figure 3: Attack Setup</p>
    <p>around the attacker the malicious modified signal will be stronger than the original signal transmitted by the tower. This will cause any televisions in the area to immediately fall victim to the attacks described below. We note that since in digital broadcasting multiple TV channels are sent from the radio tower using the same radio frequency, a single attack setup is capable of injecting attack code into several channels simultaneously.</p>
    <p>The characteristics and estimated cost of each of the components in Figure 3 are presented below:</p>
    <p>Receive antenna and DVB tuner  a USB-powered DVB tuner and a short passive antenna can be purchased online for about $15. The open-source VLC media player [33] is capable of interfacing with many of these tuners and sending the demodulated stream extracted from an entire RF channel to a file or a network socket.</p>
    <p>Content modification  the demodulated stream is modified to contain a malicious application (either as a URL, or as a full application delivered via data stream), and the PMTs of all TV channels in the demodulated stream are modified to auto-start this application as soon as the user tunes into the channel. Since the video and audio streams in the channel are forwarded without any modification, this operation is not particularly computation intensive, and any low-cost computer with USB 2.0 support can be used for this purpose. A software suite named Avalpa OpenCaster [8] provides a set of opensource command-line tools which can be used to modify a multiplexed DVB stream in real time.</p>
    <p>DVB modulator  this hardware component takes a multiplexed MPEG stream and converts it into an RF signal suitable for transmission. While these devices were once massive and expensive, modern DVB modulators are remarkably small and easy to use  a full-featured USB</p>
    <p>powered modulator which can interface with OpenCaster can be purchased online for less than $200.</p>
    <p>Power amplifier and transmit antenna  the attacker needs to create a signal that is stronger than the original TV towers signal and transmit it toward the target televisions. An attacker with a higher transmit power can affect more television sets, but a high-power setup is generally less portable, giving the attacker a higher probability of being detected and arrested. In Section 5 we formally analyze the power requirements of the attacker and show that, under the right conditions, a remarkably high amount of television sets can be affected with a moderate-to-low powered amplifier.</p>
    <p>In traditional Internet-borne attacks, it is always assumed that the attacker is himself present on the Internet before he can deliver a malicious payload to his victims. The attackers IP and DNS entries can then be used by intrusion protection services and law enforcement agencies to protect against the attack as it occurs, and to trace and prosecute its perpetrators after it has concluded. In contrast, our attacker needs no such infrastructure to deliver its malicious payload. It is surprisingly simple and inexpensive to build a digital terrestrial television (DTT) transmitter and use it to reach thousands of potential hosts. After the attack concludes, the attacker leaves no trace of his activities in the form of IP or DNS transactions.</p>
    <p>Operating an unlicensed TV transmitter is illegal in many countries. Law enforcement agencies capture these illegal transmitters by triangulation methods, which involve sending multiple car-mounted receivers to the vicinity of the attack, then using the differences in received signal strengths between receivers to locate the rogue transmitter. A sensitive receiver can also fingerprint the rogue transmitters RF envelope and help recognize it in the future. While this defense mechanism can potentially trace our radio attacker, mobile triangulation is a reactive defense step, which requires a considerable expense of time and resources from the defenders side. Considering that the attack we describe has a very limited geographical signature, operates for a very limited time (potentially only a few minutes), and causes no visible adverse effects</p>

    <p>Can we create a more secure architecture for these devices?</p>
