    <p>Mental Models</p>
    <p>A mental model is based on belief, not facts: that is, it's a model of what users know (or think they know) about a system - Jakob Nielsen</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>What keeps people from using encryption?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Why not just automate?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Because automation has its limitations</p>

    <p>Its encrypted: what does that mean?</p>

    <p>What we did Phone interviews with participants</p>
    <p>across the United States that</p>
    <p>explored:</p>
    <p>What they think encryption is</p>
    <p>How they think it works (diagramming)</p>
    <p>Their perception of its utility in daily life</p>
    <p>Data was coded and grouped into</p>
    <p>four mental models</p>

    <p>What comes to mind when you hear the word encryption?</p>

    <p>So when IS a tree really a truck?</p>

    <p>Four models of encryption</p>
    <p>Access control</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Access control</p>
    <p>Does it actually have a look?</p>
    <p>[] Its all just online. Its all</p>
    <p>zeroes and ones.</p>
    <p>I didnt really think of a</p>
    <p>physical change, really, aside</p>
    <p>from something coming up</p>
    <p>on a barrier.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Black box</p>
    <p>You dont really know</p>
    <p>what it means, but you</p>
    <p>know that it means</p>
    <p>something; you just dont</p>
    <p>know what. []</p>
    <p>I kind of know what that</p>
    <p>means, but I dont really</p>
    <p>know what theyre doing</p>
    <p>to make that happen.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Cipher</p>
    <p>The picture is split into</p>
    <p>different sections or</p>
    <p>elements and each</p>
    <p>element turns into a</p>
    <p>different element</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Iterative</p>
    <p>Either swapping or rearranging and []</p>
    <p>adding an infinite amount of extra garbage to</p>
    <p>it or just infinitely changing all the different</p>
    <p>parts of it to be different things.</p>

    <p>Encryption: for service providers</p>
    <p>Once you send the data and they get it, they can fuzz it or jumble it or do whatever they do when they encrypt it, and then you're good to go</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>and the paranoid</p>
    <p>For some people, I think it's a level of paranoia almost. To have everything need to be encrypted. But for some people [...] it's almost like a biblical need.</p>

    <p>Oh, really; thats what that</p>
    <p>means. I shouldnt do that</p>
