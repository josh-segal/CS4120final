    <p>Passwords</p>
    <p>Despite the available alternatives, password-based authentication still remains a widely used method to secure users important and valuable accounts.</p>
    <p>Weak passwords can be cracked easily, making the users account vulnerable to cyberattacks.</p>
    <p>An organizational password leak could bring in financial and reputational losses apart from legal consequences.</p>

    <p>How to Help Users Regarding Passwords?</p>
    <p>Proactive password checking tools: Password strength meters [1, 2].</p>
    <p>However, many of these tools rate passwords inconsistently [3].</p>
    <p>Advanced Data Driven Password Strength Meter by Ur. Et al has shown compelling results by scoring user passwords using a set of password heuristics [4].</p>
    <p>Tools</p>
    <p>Various training methods in cybersecurity domain have found to be helpful [6, 5, 7].</p>
    <p>Some of the previous studies involving serious games include Anti-Phishing Phil [5], CyberCIEGE [8], Phishy [6], GAP [9], Cyberaware [10], PASDJO [3] and Control-Alt-HACK [11] to name a few.</p>

    <p>Can a game-based password awareness training teach participants about the various password heuristics?</p>
    <p>Can such a training improve the organizational password diversity?</p>

    <p>Password Heuristics</p>
    <p>Heuristics: The techniques or practices that have to be satisfied to improve the overall password strength.</p>
    <p>From the previous study [4], we selected 16 heuristics based on organizational requirements and assigned them to two game levels.</p>
