    <p>Key Aspects of New Hierarchical Segmentation Method</p>
    <p>Preserve spatial relationships  use hierarchical segmentation</p>
    <p>Low computational complexity  force a specified amount of segmentation at each level of hierarchy</p>
    <p>Segmentation primarily uses color intensity  perform wavelet analysis on each K x K block of pixels</p>
    <p>(K = 4 or 8 typically)  provides info on orientation, texture, and energy</p>
    <p>Single condition for when to stop segmentation  provide three user-controllable stopping conditions</p>

    <p>Target Markets</p>
    <p>Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)</p>
    <p>Object-based video compression  e.g. MPEG-4</p>
    <p>Pattern recognition</p>
    <p>Moving object tracking</p>

    <p>ICME 2002 August 29, 2002</p>
    <p>Implementation  Separate M x N image into a set of non-overlapping blobs</p>
    <p>each blob contains K x K pixels  blobs are usually small, e.g. 4 x 4 or 8 x 8 pixels</p>
    <p>Perform wavelet on each blob  provides orientation, texture, and energy info in addition to color intensity</p>
    <p>Initialize hierarchical tree representation  define tree using basic UNION-FIND data structures:</p>
    <p>each level of tree has a weighted graph, Glevel = (Vlevel, Elevel)  each level of tree has a disjoint set of nodes, Slevel</p>
    <p>each node, vi in Vlevel, at lowest level of tree hierarchy represents a blob  each edge, ei in Elevel, connects a pair of spatially adjacent nodes  weight of each edge indicates feature distance between adjacent nodes  each set, si in Slevel, points to one or more nodes in that level</p>
    <p>at lowest level of hierarchy, each set initially points to a single node/blob</p>

    <p>ICME 2002 August 29, 2002</p>
    <p>Implementation, cont.  Merge sets at each level of hierarchy</p>
    <p>first, merge all pairs of sets whose feature distance is less than specified threshold  then, merge each remaining set of unit size (i.e. only contains one node) with at</p>
    <p>least one other set  forced set merging ensures low computation complexity</p>
    <p>Create next higher level of tree hierarchy after completing current level  create a node, vi in Vlevel, for each set si in Slevel-1  each edge, ei in Elevel, connects a pair of spatially adjacent nodes  initialize each set, si in Slevel, to point to one node, vi in Vlevel</p>
    <p>Repeat above two steps until one of three stopping conditions met:  current level contains a single node (i.e. root node of tree)  user specified number of segments as N, and current level contains N nodes  user specified feature distance of X, and feature distance between all connected</p>
    <p>nodes at current level is greater than X</p>

    <p>Feature Distance  Each node has 12 feature dimensions</p>
    <p>Six values for the mean and deviation values of RGB color intensity  Six values for the mean and deviation values of texture from the wavelet</p>
    <p>transform in the horizontal, vertical, and oblique directions  for the lowest hierarchy level, only the three mean values from wavelet analysis are</p>
    <p>used, since no deviation values can be obtained from nodes containing only one blob</p>

    <p>Computation Complexity  Overall computation complexity</p>
    <p>Forcing each set to merge with at least one other set at each level ensures that:</p>
    <p>the number of nodes in each parent level is no more than half the number of nodes in its child level</p>
    <p>the number of hierarchy levels is no more than:</p>

    <p>Conclusions  Examples confirm that hierarchical segmentation effectively</p>
    <p>preserves spatial relationships  i.e. there are no discontinuous segments</p>
    <p>Achieved low computational complexity through forced merging  will partially relax the degree of forced merging in future models</p>
    <p>Using wavelet transform on K x K-sized blobs of pixels provides texture and orientation information as well as color intensity</p>
    <p>Developed a flexible stopping mechanism  segmentation stop point may be specified via three methods:</p>
    <p>desired number of segments  maximum feature distance for merging segments  unspecified  produces full tree hierarchy representation, which may be then be</p>
    <p>traversed as necessary to find desired segment separation points</p>

    <p>Future Work  Allow pixel-level segmentation instead of just blob-level segmentation</p>
    <p>requires special method for computing feature values for pixels in the same blob</p>
    <p>Partially relax requirement that each unit-sized set be merged with at least one other set in each level</p>
    <p>require at least N percent of unit-sized sets to be merged, so that resulting number of nodes at parent levels is markedly reduced</p>
    <p>computation complexity will become a function of N</p>
    <p>Experiment with different weights for each feature dimension  currently weighting is equal across all dimensions</p>
    <p>Use machine learning for feedback-based segmentation  machine learning will adjust feature weights as appropriate</p>
