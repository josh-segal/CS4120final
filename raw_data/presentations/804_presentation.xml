    <p>Teaching Penetration Testing</p>
    <p>Businesses are increasingly ramping up internal security</p>
    <p>Penetration testing has exploded as a field</p>
    <p>Teaching pentesting has become increasingly in-demand</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Teaching Cybersecurity  Cybersecurity competitions are a effective and engaging way to students to</p>
    <p>learn and practice cybersecurity  Many different types of competitions geared to teaching different aspects of</p>
    <p>security</p>

    <p>KotH at a High Level</p>
    <p>Pivoting Large, nontrivial network topology with pivot points</p>
    <p>Implants Student teams write offensive and defensive implants</p>
    <p>Preparation Two-week project: find vulnerabilities &amp; write implants</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Gameplay</p>
    <p>Students divided into teams</p>
    <p>Each team must work together to attack, control, and defend machines over a large network topology</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Maintaining Critical Services</p>
    <p>As students claim machines, they inherit the responsibility for them  Must protect their access and critical services from other teams</p>
    <p>Weve introduced vulnerabilities  Competitors face a trade-off: patch or turn off?</p>
    <p>Scoring: Every two minutes we check for service availability  +1 point for each machine they control that is up/responsive to pings  +1 point for each functioning critical service</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Nontrivial network topology  Variety of different</p>
    <p>machines, operating systems, and services</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Territories  Each team starts</p>
    <p>with an entry node</p>
    <p>Entry machines are out of scope</p>
    <p>Territories grow/shrink as teams take/lose control of boxes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Pivots  Necessary to access</p>
    <p>other subnets</p>
    <p>High-value targets</p>
    <p>We expect these to change hands many times throughout a competition</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Critical services  FTP, SSH, HTTP,</p>
    <p>etc.</p>
    <p>Must be maintained and protected</p>
    <p>Pre-seeded vulnerabilities</p>
    <p>We expect these to become more secure throughout a competition</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Implants  Teams develop</p>
    <p>implants in advance</p>
    <p>We deploy them on target machines</p>
    <p>No teams know what or where other teams implants are</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Scorebot  Globally reachable</p>
    <p>Periodically verifies critical services are responsive</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Scorebot dashboard  Accessible by all teams</p>
    <p>Updates live as teams claim machines</p>
    <p>Shows where attacks are taking place</p>
    <p>Shows the overall accessibility of each service</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Student Preparation  Each team is given a full, isolated clone of the competition environment 2 weeks</p>
    <p>in advance of live competition to privately penetration test the network</p>
    <p>Each team could enter the competition with overlapping but different ways to access, escalate privileges, and defend different target machines</p>
    <p>In our class, each student identified 2 vulnerabilities on an image of their choice and wrote an implant as a project.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Continual Scanning  During the competition, a few highly vulnerable, unscored, hidden machines are</p>
    <p>secretly added to the network that do not appear in the initial network copies</p>
    <p>Easy to breach compared to the rest of the network</p>
    <p>Pose a threat to teams if other teams can attack them through previously unseen vectors</p>
    <p>Mimics threats faced often by real Network Operation Centers of new vulnerable or compromised machines being connected by unknowing employees, insider threats, or malicious actors</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>KotH at a High Level</p>
    <p>Pivoting Large, nontrivial network topology with pivot points</p>
    <p>Implants Student teams write offensive and defensive implants</p>
    <p>Preparation Two-week project: find vulnerabilities &amp; write implants</p>
    <p>Trade-offs In-class competition, decide what critical services to defend, patch, or turn off</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Implementation</p>
    <p>Competition backend was designed and run in Cypherpath  Virtual Software Defined Infrastructure (SDI) management program</p>
    <p>The network layout, machine information, and scorebot implementation are publicly available</p>
    <p>https://koth.cs.umd.edu</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Sample Run</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Sample Run</p>
    <p>Ran King of the Hill for our course on Introduction to Penetration Testing  Exercise ran for 3 hours</p>
    <p>Configuration:  4 teams of 4-5 people, labeled by color  Each team got an initial Kali machine reachable only by them  Six unique vulnerable images (4 Linux, 2 Windows)</p>
    <p>Duplicated them across the networks  Every teams view was symmetrical</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page"/>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Results</p>
    <p>Students were quick to close vulnerabilities after gaining access</p>
    <p>Worked to configure strong firewall policies to block traffic on unwanted ports</p>
    <p>Carefully monitored running services and processes to find malicious or vulnerable code</p>
    <p>By the end of the competition, most machines were significantly more secure than at the beginning</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Cost-Benefit</p>
    <p>Students identified some vulnerabilities that were more time-consuming to patch and chose to leave them unpatched</p>
    <p>Weighted cost of lost points during patching against the risk of another team exploiting them</p>
    <p>Multiple teams specifically reported this for EternalBlue</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Vulnerability Discovery</p>
    <p>Across all teams, students identified most access vulnerabilities</p>
    <p>Local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerabilities were most often missed by students during initial penetration test</p>
    <p>Only unprivileged access is required to trigger a phone-home to the scorebot to claim a machine  Privileged access is primarily useful for bolstering access and acting</p>
    <p>defensively</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Vulnerability Discovery</p>
    <p>Before the competition, students valued unprivileged access more than a full-chain of exploits (access + LPE)</p>
    <p>This dynamic changed during the competition</p>
    <p>Many machines had multiple teams simultaneously accessing them with unprivileged access  became a race to root of which team could escalate their privileges to</p>
    <p>kick out the other teams first and defend the machine</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Implants</p>
    <p>Students put a great deal of effort in implant development</p>
    <p>Many very strong implants were developed  Recompiled Bash with backdoors introduced  Infected/hooked PAM module  Self-hiding and self-protecting userland rootkits  Small kernel module  Self-protecting backdoor processes</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Student Feedback</p>
    <p>Student feedback was overall very positive</p>
    <p>Students became very invested in the competition, and worked hard on implants and vulnerability discovery</p>
    <p>Students liked the dual attack-defense nature coupled with the ability to strategize</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Customize KotH for Your Class</p>
    <p>Pivoting Specific vulnerabilities can vary based on class goalsNetwork topology can establish attack prerequisites</p>
    <p>Implants Class projects could require certain attacks/defenses</p>
    <p>Preparation Varying amount of details can be provided</p>
    <p>Trade-offs Patch vs. turn off; easy vs. hard targets; attack vs. defend</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>King of the Hill is a novel cybersecurity competition that provides hands-on experience with real-world penetration testing practices</p>
    <p>Combines  network pivoting  custom implant development  advanced preparation</p>
    <p>Initial in-class run of KotH indicates that it creates an exciting environment in which students gain valuable pentesting practice</p>
