    <p>Auditing a DRE-Based Election</p>

    <p>Elections in South Carolina</p>
    <p>Statewide adoption of ES&amp;S iVotronics DRE (2006-forward) with county-level accumulation on Unity ERM software</p>
    <p>Absentee voting on paper or on DREs at county headquarters</p>
    <p>No paper trail</p>
    <p>No post-election auditing (as of 11/02/2010)</p>

    <p>The Election Procedure</p>
    <p>Greenstripe master PEB to open and close iVotronic terminals</p>
    <p>Redstripe PEB used for individual votes  Closing causes event log and vote image file to</p>
    <p>be written to a compact flash memory card as an audit trail</p>
    <p>Totals collected into PEB at closing  PEB totals become paper tape total for posting</p>
    <p>at the precinct level at closing  PEB totals accumulated at county HQ  Results to be certified by Friday for a Tuesday</p>
    <p>election</p>

    <p>Observed Failures (1)</p>
    <p>If two PEBs (or more) are used to open and close in a pct, then maybe only one gets uploaded to the totals. Ward 21, Richland County</p>
    <p>Racepath Precinct, Horry County 114 votes not counted from 1 terminal</p>
    <p>Actually, several hundred terminals statewide opened and closed with different PEBs. Given audit data, we can detect this.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>August 11, 11 Computer Science and Engineering 7</p>
    <p>Observed Failures (2)</p>
    <p>If terminals are not closed, their votes are not collected. Bluff Precinct, Richland County</p>
    <p>Six of eight machines not closed 772 votes not counted Multiple warnings overlooked</p>
    <p>Given audit data, we can detect this.</p>
    <p>OTOH, there is apparently a way to collect totals without leaving an audit trail.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>August 11, 11 Computer Science and Engineering 8</p>
    <p>Observed Failures (3)</p>
    <p>The memory cards are supposed to be collected with their audit data at the county level. Apparently this is frequently not done.</p>
    <p>Richland County, about 30/820 cards Horry County, 53 of 125 precincts Beaufort and McCormick, on 3/28/2011 Charleston, not yet?</p>
    <p>Existence of some problems can sometimes be detected by the absence of the data. Correction of the problems seems to require the data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>August 11, 11 Computer Science and Engineering 9</p>
    <p>Observed Failures (4)</p>
    <p>Test votes wind up in the official file of votes Lexington County, 25 votes over 17 precincts Horry County, 3 votes in 3 different precincts</p>
    <p>Two suggestions for how this could happen.</p>
    <p>The votes have bizarre patterns and are thus identifiable.</p>
    <p>Given audit data, we can easily detect this.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>August 11, 11 Computer Science and Engineering 10</p>
    <p>What Did We Do?</p>
    <p>FOIA of EL68, EL68A, EL152, EL155 files from about 20 counties, mostly from 11/02/2010, but some from 6/8/2010 and 6/22/2010. Not all counties complied, not all quickly, not all completely. Programs by Buell and Moore separately, cross referencing results. Lots of caveats about our results due to incomplete/insufficient dataWE VERY MUCH WISH WE COULD BE MORE AUTHORITATIVE AND LESS ANECDOTAL.</p>

    <p>Accounting for the PEBs</p>
    <p>The 152 file records opening and closing the terminals by PEB number.</p>
    <p>The 152 file has the vote cast events for existence of votes. The 155 file has the actual votes (randomized).</p>
    <p>The 68A file records (except in Beaufort!) uploads of totals from the PEBs, by number, to the county totals.</p>
    <p>Given the data, we can reconcile the totals.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>August 11, 11 Computer Science and Engineering 15</p>
    <p>Accounting for the Terminals</p>
    <p>If we had a list of terminals used in an election,</p>
    <p>and the memory card data has been properly collected,</p>
    <p>we can verify that all terminals were closed and track which PEB did the close.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>August 11, 11 Computer Science and Engineering 16</p>
    <p>Accounting for the Memory Cards</p>
    <p>If the state certifies votes from the PEB totals,</p>
    <p>but the memory card data isnt collected,</p>
    <p>then the vote image file comes up short.</p>
    <p>Totals can be collected a second time without leaving an audit trail?</p>
    <p>Accumulating 152 and 155 data takes TWO steps by the operator.</p>
