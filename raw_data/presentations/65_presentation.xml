    <p>Global P2P Resilience Motivation</p>
    <p>Motivation I</p>
    <p>Previous Techniques</p>
    <p>Traditional study of P2P resilience centers around uniform, independent, simultaneous node failure</p>
    <p>Nodes fail with independent probability p</p>
    <p>The analysis of Chord is a typical example of this</p>
    <p>Using p = 0.5, the paper determines what node degree is necessary to ensure that each node stays connected (i.e., is not isolated) with high probability after the failure</p>
    <p>For Chord, we have:</p>
    <p>P (isolated) = pdegree  1</p>

    <p>Example: n = 100 billion, k must be at least 37</p>

    <p>Effect of Isolated Nodes</p>
    <p>How does the absence of isolated vertices affect the networks connectivity?</p>
    <p>This topic has been research extensively in random graph theory and interconnection networks</p>
    <p>Erdos and Renyi in the 1960s demonstrated that almost every (i.e., with probability 1  o(1) as n  ) random graph is connected if and only if it has no isolated vertices.</p>
    <p>P (G is connected) = P (G has no isolated nodes)</p>
    <p>Almost every disconnection occurs with at least one isolation</p>

    <p>Deterministic Networks</p>
    <p>Burtin (1977) and Bollobas (1983) showed that the same result applies to certain deterministic graphs such as hypercubes</p>
    <p>This can be extended to any graph with similar or better node expansion properties (Chord, CAN, Pastry, etc.)</p>

    <p>The tested P2P graphs (Chord, Symphony, CAN, Pastry, Randomized Chord, de Bruijn, and several unstructured random graphs) remained connected almost surely as long as they did not have an isolated node</p>
