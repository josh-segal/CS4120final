    <p>Humans are incapable of securely storing highquality cryptographic keys they are also large, expensive to maintain, difficult to manage, and they pollute the environment. It is astonishing that these devices continue to be manufactured and deployed. But they are sufficiently pervasive that we must design our protocols around their limitations.</p>

    <p>Congratulations! You have learned the first two words of your security code. We have added another two words. Just like the first two words, once you have learned them, you can type them without waiting for the hint to appear.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>imagine my disappointment when I was rewarded for memorizing the first code by having another one added. I envisioned having code a^er code added to the end un1l infinity but I discovered that if I refused to play the game at all then the length of the code never grew more.</p>
    <p>it was kind of clear a^er learning the first pair that this would just result in a third pair and a fourth pair and ... I have to admit that I was kind of pleased that it worked and I wasn't forced to learn more and more ... Hooray!</p>
    <p>I'd rather wait a few seconds and have a shorter code.</p>
    <p>Your system should have recorded that I NEVER NOT ONCE typed it in at all before the ``hint'' appeared. I doubt my dog would feel like memorizing password just to be given more passwords to memorize. I mean are you serious? If there are people that fell for that please do not tell me as I would be very disappointed and fearful for the future of humanity. lol</p>
