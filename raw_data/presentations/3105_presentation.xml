    <p>Arbitrary voting system</p>
    <p>We note that a Bayes audit works for an arbitrary voting system as long as the number of ballot types is not too large; all you need is a way to compute the winner of a profile of ballots, and a way of sampling ballots. We have tested it on</p>
    <p>I plurality I IRV I Borda I Schulze</p>
    <p>with good results.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Bayesian comparison audits</p>
    <p>I Same idea, but have one urn for each reported type.</p>
    <p>I Much more efficient!! (But needs way of matching paper ballots with their reported types.)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>I Ballot-polling. I Two candidates (plus write-ins). I 2011 votes cast: 1353 for Lewis, 742 for</p>
    <p>Mancini (reported). I Starks ballot-polling audit with 10% risk limit</p>
    <p>examined: 89 ballots.</p>
    <p>I A Bayes ballot-polling audit with  = 0.10 examines:</p>

    <p>Discussion</p>
    <p>I We conjecture that a Bayes audit is in fact risk-limiting (perhaps given some suitable assumptions or constant factors in parameterization). But this is just a conjecture.</p>
    <p>I The Bayes audit admits the use of other priors, such as those a very partisan observer might have.</p>
    <p>I The Bayes audit admits the use of multiple priors; only stopping when all auditors (with different priors) agree to do so.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Summary  Bayes Audit Advantages</p>
    <p>I High efficiency (few ballots get audited). I Small/controllable miscertification rates</p>
    <p>observed. I Simple in structure / easy to implement. I Handles ballot-polling audits, comparison</p>
    <p>audits, and many different voting systems. I No MOV computation required to start. I Admits flexible (multiple) choice(s) of prior. I Can be stopped early with meaningful</p>
    <p>results.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Summary  Bayes Audit Disadvantages</p>
    <p>I Only works (so far) for single-ballot audits. I Unclear relationship to risk-limiting audits. I Results depend on choice(s) for prior. I Need program to compute winning</p>
    <p>probabilities.</p>
