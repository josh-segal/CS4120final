    <p>Storage which is slow but cheap</p>
    <p>Tape and optical disc</p>
    <p>Cheap because of not only price of media but also reduced electricity usage and long media life</p>
    <p>No electricity is required unless they are accessed</p>
    <p>Long media life: 30 years for a tape and 50 years for an optical disc</p>
    <p>Suitable for large, less frequently accessed archival data</p>
    <p>Example use cases</p>
    <p>Facebook migrates old photos to optical disc storage</p>
    <p>50 percent cheaper than using hard disk drives for cold storage, and 80 percent more energy efficient [CES press conf. 16]</p>
    <p>ECMWF stores weather information onto tape storage which capacity exceeds 50PB [Grawinkel et al. 15]</p>
    <p>Cold Storage</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Media Exchange Incurs Large Latency</p>
    <p>A reason why they are slow is a large latency incurred by media exchange</p>
    <p>Media and drives are separated</p>
    <p>In contrast to all-in-one device such as HDD or SSD</p>
    <p>A few minutes to exchange media</p>
    <p>A robot carries media between shelves and drives inside a library</p>
    <p>Media exchange is norm rather than special [Grawinkel et al. 15]</p>
    <p>9 loadings / minute</p>
    <p>231 drives, 32,712 tapes</p>
    <p>Active archive usage must increase for the purpose of big data analysis</p>
    <p>In contrast to backup and deep archive</p>
    <p>Reducing media exchange must lower a barrier for installing cold storage</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Placing Correlated Data Together</p>
    <p>Placing correlated data together is helpful for reducing media exchange</p>
    <p>E.g., A case for log of users actions</p>
    <p>Log is a good example of using cold storage</p>
    <p>Can become enormous in a large system</p>
    <p>Can be kept for a long time as evidence</p>
    <p>Its rare for all the logs to be accessed frequently</p>
    <p>Logs are typically collected in time order</p>
    <p>E.g., Discovering a root cause of a failure by checking logs around the time of occurrence</p>
    <p>Should be stored in the order of generation</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Multi-dimensional Searches Disrupt It</p>
    <p>Logs can be mined in multiple ways</p>
    <p>E.g., Focusing a particular action</p>
    <p>Searching for a malicious employee who leaked confidential information by checking only taking out files</p>
    <p>In this case the layout on the right side is more suitable</p>
    <p>On the contrary, if all the actions are required, the left one is more suitable</p>
    <p>One layout doesnt much both requirements</p>
    <p>Not just in the case of log</p>
    <p>Another example is weather information mined in temporal and spatial manner</p>

    <p>Assumptions</p>
    <p>Mean number of media exchange is modeled as 1 +</p>
    <p>equals the amount of reading data, which is normalized with media size</p>
    <p>One medium holds exactly one days logs in the original layout</p>
    <p>Time for reading data increases proportionally to the data amount</p>
    <p>In other words, exclude seek time from latency</p>
    <p>Simulation based on blu-ray</p>
