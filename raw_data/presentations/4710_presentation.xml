    <p>Combinatorial Auctions</p>
    <p>There are multiple goods for sale.</p>
    <p>Bidders may have non-additive valuations over goods.</p>
    <p>Definition (CA mechanism)</p>
    <p>In a combinatorial auction (CA) mechanism, multiple goods are sold simultaneously and bidders are allowed to place bids on bundles, rather than just on individual goods. The mechanism decides on the allocation of goods and the payments given the bids.</p>

    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>There is no deterministic CA mechanism that satisfies strategyproofness, participation, consumer sovereignty, maximality, and revenue monotonicity.</p>
    <p>In deterministic CA mechanisms, more bidders does not necessarily mean more competition.</p>
    <p>There exist stepwise randomized CA mechanisms defined for known single-minded bidders that satisfy strategyproofness, participation, consumer sovereignty, maximality and revenue monotonicity.</p>
    <p>We characterized the class of all such mechanisms. We gave a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing such a mechanism.</p>

    <p>Investigate optimally setting the parameters over which we have design freedom:</p>
    <p>(0,...,0)(a)s; set of maximal allocations in the support of the mechanism; ;  (as long as it is small enough); and ci,j s.</p>
    <p>Prove or disprove the conjecture that we can allow ci,js to depend on v . Extend our result to unknown single-minded bidders or prove that such an extension is impossible.</p>
