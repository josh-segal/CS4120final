    <p>Securing Healthcare records is a difficult task</p>
    <p>Digital records can be copied verbatim, exposing confidential patient information</p>
    <p>Attacks can occur from both within and outside the organization</p>
    <p>Various privacy laws around the world strictly regulate the digital storage of healthcare records</p>
    <p>Our goal: Look into the regulations, and derive a common set of storage/security requirements for healthcare records</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Finding a common theme in regulations</p>
    <p>Different countries around the world have different regulations on healthcare information management</p>
    <p>A common set of requirements can be derived from the requirements</p>
    <p>Research on healthcare records should follow these common criteria</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Case study: HIPAA</p>
    <p>HIPAA stands for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996</p>
    <p>Regulates insurance industry (Title I), and mandates the confidentiality and privacy of medical information (Title II)</p>
    <p>Compliance is mandatory for organizations handling healthcare information</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>HIPAAs security requirements</p>
    <p>Privacy:  Organizations must ensure reasonable</p>
    <p>measures for safeguarding privacy and confidentiality</p>
    <p>Security:  Internal audit procedures for medical data are</p>
    <p>mandatory for all organizations  Records must be disposed of in a trustworthy</p>
    <p>manner after the mandatory retention period  Data integrity must be ensured via checksums</p>
    <p>or signatures</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Other requirements of HIPAA</p>
    <p>Media re-use:  All information need to be removed before re</p>
    <p>use of storage media</p>
    <p>Accountability:  All data access and migration operations must</p>
    <p>be logged</p>
    <p>Backup and Storage:  Organizations must provide backup of all</p>
    <p>information</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Other laws around the world also mandate various security requirements</p>
    <p>OSHA:  Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires all</p>
    <p>employee exposure records to be maintained for 30 years</p>
    <p>EU Directive 95/46/EC  Article 6 requires accuracy guarantees of personal records, and</p>
    <p>guaranteed disposal after the retention period.  Article 17 requires measures for ensuring the confidentiality and</p>
    <p>availability of records.</p>
    <p>UK Data Protection Act of 1998  Requires mandatory disposal of electronic records after retention</p>
    <p>period,  Mandates accuracy of information,  Requires logging any changes, and strict confidentiality.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>A common set of requirements can be derived from these laws</p>
    <p>Confidentiality and access control</p>
    <p>Integrity</p>
    <p>Availability and performance</p>
    <p>Logging, audit trails, and provenance</p>
    <p>Long term secure retention and migration</p>
    <p>Backup</p>
    <p>Cost effectiveness</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Existing storage models do not address all these requirements</p>
    <p>Relational databases  Most commonly used model for healthcare</p>
    <p>records</p>
    <p>Encryption provides confidentiality, but does not protect records from malicious insiders, and also makes queries on encrypted records less efficient</p>
    <p>IBMs Hippocratic Database technology can provide fine grained access control, and compliant auditing, but is still vulnerable to insider attacks</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Existing storage models do not address all these requirements (2)</p>
    <p>Object-based storage systems:  Document content hashes are used to locate</p>
    <p>documents</p>
    <p>Allows efficient retrieval for read operations</p>
    <p>Document integrity is ensured</p>
    <p>But Appends and Writes are difficult, and inefficient</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Existing storage models do not address all these requirements (3)</p>
    <p>Regulatory Compliant WORM Storage  Records kept in Write-once, Read-many times</p>
    <p>media (optical, magnetic, etc.)</p>
    <p>Trustworthy indexing, migration, and deletion mechanisms can ensure trustworthy retention and movement of records</p>
    <p>But mainly suitable for data that do not change often, and do not require frequent corrections</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Wish list of features</p>
    <p>A storage model for healthcare records should be:  Efficient in performance, cheap in cost</p>
    <p>Allow both efficient and secure reads and writes / updates / corrections to records</p>
    <p>Handle trustworthy indexing, retention, migration and deletions of records</p>
    <p>Provide detailed provenance information for records, documenting the history of the information</p>
