    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>This talk presents our work on &quot;Security Impact of High Resolution Smartphone Cameras&quot;:</p>
    <p>By now nearly every smartphone has at least one, usually two high quality cameras.</p>

    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>This talk presents our work on &quot;Security Impact of High Resolution Smartphone Cameras&quot;:</p>
    <p>Getting the camera permission with an evil app is apparently rather easy [Felt et al., 2011, Felt et al., 2012].</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Contribution</p>
    <p>We demonstrate, that the front camera of modern smartphones can be used for visual keylogging. Without the need of physical proximity [Xu et al., 2013] and with higher precision than previous approaches [Simon and Anderson, 2013]. We evaluate the required border conditions and possible mitigation for this approach.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Contribution</p>
    <p>We demonstrate how and that an attacker can obtain high quality fingerprint images of a target, sufficient to utilize forgeries created from them on the most advanced sensors.</p>

    <p>So... why does this happen?</p>
    <p>People do like the feature of having a camera with them... always.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>So... why does this happen?</p>
    <p>Pictures taken should not be like... pixel-heaps.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>So... why does this happen?</p>
    <p>And of course a front camera for serious video-conferencing!</p>
    <p>Ok, just kidding, more like for what the sales-droids call &quot;generation selfie&quot; - at least the high resolution ones, 8 Megapixel and up.</p>

    <p>Attacker and Victim Model</p>
    <p>Attacker: Somebody with a lot of resources...</p>
    <p>With a lot of knowledge on computers...</p>
    <p>Mainly attacking high-profile targets...</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>So, who might it be?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>About the victim...</p>
    <p>Interesting enough for our attacker.</p>
    <p>Probably using some fancy secure-phone.</p>
    <p>Probably somewhat well known... or something...</p>

    <p>Yeah... might be her...</p>

    <p>So, how do we do keylogging with the camera?</p>
    <p>Use reflections in the user's face.</p>
    <p>Ideally sunglasses, worst case: eyes. Used by Xu et al. for some really advanced shoulder surfing using e.g. camcorders while standing nearby [Xu et al., 2013].</p>

    <p>Wait, can this work?</p>
    <p>Xu et al. had perfect reconstruction using the shadow of the moving (input) finger, if the display reflection in the recording had a size of around 10px.</p>
    <p>Gave us a nice formula to calculate how big the reflection for a given camera and a given distance is:</p>
    <p>SizeReflection = (SensorResolutionSensorSize  ObjectSize</p>
    <p>TargetDistance FocalLength 1</p>
    <p>)  12DistanceFromSurface CurvatureRadius +1</p>

    <p>But what if our victims wears sunglasses?</p>

    <p>Of course we prefer sunglasses like these...</p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>Front-cameras in smartphones make rather good keyloggers.</p>
    <p>Back-cameras are rather useful at extracting biometric features.</p>
    <p>Mitigation is hard.</p>
