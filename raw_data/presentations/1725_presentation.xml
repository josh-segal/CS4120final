    <p>Motivation</p>
    <p>Storage breaches have become a part of daily lives</p>
    <p>Everyone is affected at one point or another   CardSystems incident lost 40 million records</p>
    <p>Veterans Administration incident lost 28.6 million records</p>
    <p>Sometimes, theft of hardware exposes records indirectly</p>
    <p>Insight into the type of breach, and type of records lost may allow better and well focused security measures</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals</p>
    <p>To look into the largely uncategorized raw data in order to  Summarize data in various dimensions</p>
    <p>Find underlying patterns in the incidents</p>
    <p>Compare incidents</p>
    <p>Show vulnerabilities in various organizations</p>
    <p>To provide a online information source for further analysis</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Breach Disclosure Laws</p>
    <p>Storage breaches are mostly reported only because there are state breach-reporting laws</p>
    <p>As of 2006, only 28 states have storage breach reporting laws</p>
    <p>These laws mandate  Notification of the customers</p>
    <p>But not the notification in the media</p>
    <p>A federal law is needed to ensure consistency</p>

  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>This paper</p>
    <p>Deals with only disclosed storage security breaches  By disclosed we mean the breach report has</p>
    <p>been published in the news media or otherwise</p>
    <p>This is most likely a fraction of other undisclosed storage security breaches (in other words, just the tip of the iceberg!! )</p>

    <p>Data Sources</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Data sources</p>
    <p>PrivacyRights.org  Provides information on incidents,</p>
    <p>breach types, and record counts  Has info on 95 million record losses</p>
    <p>since Feb 15, 2005  182 breach incidents reported</p>
    <p>between Feb 05-July 06</p>
    <p>Attrition.org  Collects information from news</p>
    <p>sources  183 breach incidents reported</p>
    <p>between Jan 05-July 06</p>

    <p>Our analysis</p>
    <p>Time period:  January 1, 2005-July 5, 2006</p>
    <p>Data items from these sources were  merged</p>
    <p>duplicates removed</p>
    <p>resolved incidents removed</p>
    <p>Final dataset:  219 breach incidents</p>
    <p>For each incident, size in records, data type, breach type, organization types etc. were recorded</p>
