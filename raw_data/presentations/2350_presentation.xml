    <p>How Relevant is the Australian Ballot?</p>
    <p>Of course, many systems that offer inferior protections against coercion are in common use (e.g. Vote by Mail).</p>
    <p>There are scattered reports of employer coercion.</p>
    <p>Spousal coercion seems to be a real issue.</p>
    <p>Best election practices dictate publicly-monitored in-person voting as the only effective protection against coercion.</p>

    <p>Simple Coercion</p>
    <p>We go to poll together.</p>
    <p>I give you camcorder glasses.</p>

    <p>Varieties of Coercion</p>
    <p>Perhaps a more careful analysis of different forms of coercion will give us some room to breathe.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Coercion versus Vote-Selling</p>
    <p>Is there a difference between involuntary coercion and voluntary vote-selling?</p>
    <p>Not really, a voter can voluntarily take the same actions.</p>
    <p>If a voter can be coerced, a voter can sell coercion rights.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Local versus Remote Coercion</p>
    <p>Can the same attack be performed remotely?</p>
    <p>Yes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Remote Coercion</p>
    <p>Find a mirror near the polls.</p>
    <p>Get a gook look at yourself.</p>

    <p>Retail versus Wholesale Coercion</p>
    <p>Are the attacks practical at a large scale?</p>
    <p>Yes.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Scalable Remote Coercion</p>
    <p>A coercer</p>
    <p>need not spend $20 per voter per election</p>
    <p>can spot check videos of voting</p>
    <p>use high-speed playback</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Time of Coercion</p>
    <p>Does time of coercion matter?</p>
    <p>Yes, coercion (vote-selling) must be premeditated.</p>
    <p>Good election protocols can prevent afterthe-fact coercion.</p>
    <p>Some protocols can push the boundary time back so that coercion would have to be initiated prior to registration.</p>

    <p>Remote Voting Protocol</p>
    <p>Legitimate credentials are obtained during a confidential registration phase.</p>
    <p>Voters (optionally) engage in interactive proofs to ensure that the credentials they receive are valid.</p>
    <p>Voters can generate additional illegitimate credentials.</p>
    <p>Any credentials can be used to cast an encrypted vote.</p>
    <p>Verifiable process applied to set of all votes cast produces a tally of legitimate votes only.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Simplified (non-verifiable) JCJ</p>
    <p>A credential is just a random ID number.</p>
    <p>Election officials maintain a (secret) list of validly-issued IDs.</p>
    <p>Each vote is submitted with an ID.</p>
    <p>Only votes with legitimate IDs are counted.</p>

    <p>The Coerced Voter</p>
    <p>Register in person.</p>
    <p>Receive a legitimate credential.</p>
    <p>Upon leaving, pick up some additional credentials from a basket of illegitimate credentials.</p>
    <p>Voters may add any markings they desire.</p>

    <p>The Skeptical Voter</p>
    <p>Register in person.</p>
    <p>Upon entering, pick up some credentials from a basket of legitimate credentials.</p>
    <p>Select one legitimate credential for permanent use and have the rest recorded by an official.</p>
    <p>All unselected credentials are proven to be legitimate by subsequent publication.</p>

    <p>Effective Mitigation of Early Coercion</p>
    <p>Election registrars can be trained to recognize cameras and enforce rules.</p>
    <p>Devices can be installed to detect unshielded circuits.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Paradigm Trade-Offs</p>
    <p>In-person voting</p>
    <p>Coercion must precede voting</p>
    <p>Appear once per election</p>
    <p>Appear election days only</p>
    <p>Transient staffing</p>
    <p>Distributed</p>
    <p>In-person registration</p>
    <p>Coercion must precede registration</p>
    <p>Appear once  ever</p>
    <p>Appear any time</p>
    <p>Permanent staffing</p>
    <p>Centralized</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Why Vote Remotely?</p>
    <p>Theres little remaining benefit to voting in person.</p>
    <p>Its easier for a coerced voter to steal 5 minutes of Internet access then to surreptitiously vote in person.</p>
    <p>Voter turnout could be enhanced.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Why Not Vote Remotely?</p>
    <p>Malware can compromise privacy and may be able to steal credentials  this is a benefit of smart card credentials over simple IDs.*</p>
    <p>Some voters have poor access to or are uncomfortable with technology.*</p>
    <p>*Vote by Mail may be possible here.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>An Outrageous Claim</p>
    <p>Monitored in-person voting is no longer the most coercion-resistant voting method.</p>
    <p>Instead, remote voting with JCJ-style credentials offers greater resistance to coercion by time-shifting the period of vulnerability and centralizing the monitoring.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Consequences of Claim</p>
    <p>UOCAVA challenges may have feasible solutions.</p>
    <p>Election protocol design should be reevaluated.  Extraordinary efforts that mitigate only some</p>
    <p>forms of coercion seem ill-advised.</p>
    <p>Many protocols warrant re-design.</p>
