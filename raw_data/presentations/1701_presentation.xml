    <p>Crawl and download all JSes in the Alexa T-5K.  Over 200K JS in Alexa T-5K.  Analyzing (functionality of) each one is not feasible.</p>

    <p>How do anti-adblockers work?</p>
    <p>Key idea: Bait objects.  Example 1: Using a bait DIV element</p>
    <p>var test = document.createElement('div'); //Create a new DIV element test.innerHTML = '&amp;nbsp;; test.className = 'adsbox; //Set bait</p>
    <p>document.body.appendChild(test); //Add element to document body</p>

    <p>Key idea: Bait objects.  Example 2: Using bait JSes</p>
    <p>// ads.js var foo = False</p>
    <p>// main.js var foo = True // main.html if (foo is True) {</p>

    <p>Can adblockers block anti-adblockers?</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>TL; DR</p>
    <p>Anti-adblockers are employed by at least 6.7% of the Alexa T-5K.</p>
    <p>Anti-adblockers are mostly employed by News websites.</p>
    <p>Anti-adblockers are being supplied mostly by ad vendors.  PageFair report should be taken with a grain of salt (conflict of interest).</p>
    <p>The arms race has entered the next phase.  Escalation seems likely unless a compromise is found (e.g., Eyeo AAI).</p>
