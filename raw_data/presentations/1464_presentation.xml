    <p>Some Notions</p>
    <p>A tally T is represented by a representation R. A representation R represents the tallies in a set TR A set R of representations is complete, if every tally has a representation R R. Two tallies are -neighboured, if each candidates numbers of votes in the two tallies do not differ by more than .</p>

    <p>,-Fuzzable Election</p>
    <p>,-fuzzable: Let T be the set of all possible tallies of a given election. We call this election ,-fuzzable if there is a complete set R of representations such that for each representation R R and its set of represented tallies TR T :</p>
    <p>his number of votes in TR .</p>
