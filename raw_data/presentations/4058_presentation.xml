    <p>Implications on Existing Techniques</p>
    <p>TOPP uses packet-pairs to measure the stochastic response curve and implicitly assumes that it is the same as the fluid curve  To avoid bias, TOPP must use trains of sufficient length</p>
    <p>Pathload and PTR are related to searching for the turning point in the single-hop fluid response curve  Since they are using long trains, they are often immune to</p>

    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>We derived the multi-hop fluid response curve with arbitrary cross-traffic routing</p>
    <p>Also derived the multi-hop response curve using packetbased cross-traffic models and showed its convergence to its fluid counterpart when packet-train length increases</p>
    <p>Our results provided a stochastic justification of the existing techniques using long-trains</p>
    <p>Uncovered the sources of measurement biases for the techniques using short trains</p>
    <p>Leads to new techniques for measuring the tight link capacity (implementation in progress)</p>
