    <p>Common Complaints</p>
    <p>Not enough spectrum  Small amount of commercial spectrum low data rates  True, but scarcity a by-product of an antiquated FCC</p>
    <p>A large fraction of allocated spectrum is unused  New opportunities, new FCC policies  Wireless LAN has 80+ MHz, we use only ~20 MHz</p>
    <p>Wideband systems expensive to build  True a decade ago  Ultra-wideband radios, cognizant radios,</p>
    <p>Claims  Lots of spectrum available, we just dont use it well  Opportunities to exploit large amounts of spectrum cheaply</p>

    <p>Genie-aided Capacity</p>
    <p>Assume all K band channels are known perfectly  Capacity-achieving method chooses the best band</p>
    <p>Gains from opportunism  Linear in per-band bandwidth, B  Doubly logarithmic growth in number of bands, K</p>
    <p>Large number of bands not useful, large bandwidth is</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Single-rate Transmission</p>
    <p>Transmitter makes no attempt to learn the channel  Chooses a fixed rate R  Only receiver measures the channel with overhead</p>
    <p>When current channel capacity less than R, the packet is lost</p>
    <p>Net throughput</p>
    <p>Throughput is independent of # of bands, K</p>

    <p>Measurement-based Band Selection</p>
    <p>Measure Km bands before sending data  Overhead = Km (2) fraction of total time</p>
    <p>Grows linearly with number of measured bands</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Optimal Number of Bands</p>
    <p>R*(Km) grows doubly-logarithmic in Km  Overhead grows linearly in Km  As Km, Rm(Km) 0</p>
    <p>More opportunism  more throughput</p>
    <p>In fact, there is an optimal K*m</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>More Bands or More Bandwidth ?</p>
    <p>Given bandwidth W=KB, how should we divide it  More bands, K ? Or  More bandwidth/band, B ?</p>
    <p>Proposition: For both genie-aided and measurement-based systems, B=W is throughput optimal.</p>
    <p>If you can, do not divide into smaller bands  Cost could be a factor  Unclear if network-wide optimal</p>

    <p>Recap</p>
    <p>The short time-scale opportunism has its limits  Measurement overhead Vs. the benefit derived from it  Optimal strategy is to check a small number of bands</p>
    <p>Analogy for students  Many great research topics, but jump too often and the overhead</p>
    <p>will kill you</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Goals for Protocol Design</p>
    <p>Context is IEEE 802.11a/b/g  Coherence bandwidth is 1-3 MHz</p>
    <p>Multiple bands (11+) which are &gt;5MHz  Some bands completely orthogonal (3 to 8)</p>
    <p>Both temporal and spectral opportunism available</p>
    <p>Two main parts  Accessing the floor  Measuring and choosing the right band</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>MOAR Protocol Sketch</p>
    <p>Accessing the floor  Assign a home band for all the nodes  Everyone contends in the home band using IEEE 802.11 DCF  Use 4-way handshake (RTS/CTS/DATA/ACK)</p>
    <p>Measuring channel quality in different bands  RTS/CTS used for channel measurement  If band SNR &lt; threshold, skip to a new band (piggybacked in CTS)  Continue skipping till you beneficial</p>
    <p>Multi-band Opportunistic Auto-rate (MOAR)  Stopping rule  Adaptation for each node</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Stopping Rule</p>
    <p>Nodes make a run-time decision on how many bands to measure  The number different for each node  Number varies with time due to node mobility</p>
    <p>Pose it as stopping rule problem  Marriage problem: How many people you meet before making</p>
    <p>THE decision ?</p>
    <p>In our problem  Recall is possible, but need to ensure no one else has the band</p>
    <p>after we left  Conservative approach: stopping rule without recall</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Optimal Stopping Rule</p>
    <p>Optimal rule is threshold based  If Raten &lt; V*, continue; if Raten &gt; V* stop  N* = min{n  1: Raten  V*}</p>
    <p>V* = E max(Rate1,V*)  c</p>
    <p>F(Rate) represents the Rate distribution</p>
    <p>c is cost of measurement</p>
    <p>F(Rate) depends  Average SNR  Fading parameters K-factor, distance,</p>
    <p>!</p>
    <p>(Rate&quot;V*)dF(Rate) V*</p>
    <p>#</p>
    <p>$ = c</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Using Time Coherence</p>
    <p>To exploit time coherence (OAR)  Send multiple back to back packets  Number of packets = (Current rate)/(Base rate)  Higher rates imply higher number of packets</p>
    <p>OAR ensures  Same time-fairness as single-rate IEEE 802.11  Opportunistically reduces contention  Gets large gains over IEEE 802.11</p>
    <p>Whenever skipping stops  Send number of packets based on OAR</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>MOAR Throughput Gains</p>
    <p>Temporal opportunism - OAR  Temporal + spectral opportunism - MOAR  Gains of 40%-60% increasing with Ricean K-factor and SNR variance</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Effect of Node Distance  Greatest help when far away  Non-monotonic due to rate-SNR thresholds</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Conclusions</p>
    <p>Case for spectral reuse  Many services sporadically used  Reuse spectrum when available</p>
    <p>Reusing requires finding availablility  Interference, channel quality</p>
    <p>Fundamental tradeoff between discovering and using opportunism</p>
    <p>Real gains available, nonetheless  Practical protocol in 802.11 framework</p>
    <p>Many-fold gain over current standards</p>
