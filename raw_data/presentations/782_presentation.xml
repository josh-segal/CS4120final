    <p>Data Curation Settings  Fine-grained data from multiple sources</p>
    <p>Integrated, queried, and further updated or manipulated  Evolving schema and instance</p>
    <p>Multiple histories that include manipulations and queries</p>
    <p>Multiple values for attributes</p>
    <p>User expressions of confidence and doubt</p>
    <p>Example Settings  Intelligence: profiling persons of interest</p>

    <p>Bob 8, 9</p>
    <p>Sue 7</p>
    <p>Do we trust the people that derived it?  Do we trust how and in what order it was derived?  Do we know which source(s)* data came from?  If processing methods were used to derive the data, have they improved or changed?</p>

    <p>Where Current Models Fall Short,1  Provenance is limited</p>
    <p>Single history  Single granularity (mostly)  Query or DML, but not both (mostly)</p>
    <p>Some models store provenance in the same schema as the data  Annotations stored as extra attributes  Creates clutter, and requires special care to</p>
    <p>prevent corruption during queries 5</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Where Current Models Fall Short, 2</p>
    <p>Provenance stored as string annotations to data, so queries about provenance must parse the strings used by a particular system</p>
    <p>Provenance stored one generation at a time, so queries must be written recursively, to trace provenance through multiple prior queries</p>
