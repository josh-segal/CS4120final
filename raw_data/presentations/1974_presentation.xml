    <p>Todays Problem: IoT DDoS</p>
    <p>KrebsOnSecurity (Sept 16), Dyn (Oct16),</p>
    <p>Used IP cams, home routers (IoT devices)</p>
    <p>Use of weak passwords</p>
    <p>DDoS using Mirai botnet on IoT devices</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>The Root Cause: Insecure Devices  Malicious botnets</p>
    <p>infecting devices</p>
    <p>Accidental lapses in security policy enforcing</p>
    <p>Lets face it !</p>
    <p>It is impossible to ensure every device will always be secure</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>DDoS: Old Problem - New Face</p>
    <p>Have been around for more than a decade  Absorb DDoS attacks, counter IP spoofing, harden systems, firewalls, IDPS,</p>
    <p>load balancing, active resource monitoring</p>
    <p>Recent DDoS attacks are application level attacks using IoT devices</p>
    <p>We call them -- IoT-DDoS</p>
    <p>Bots uses massive amounts of seemingly legitimate traffic  Extremely challenging to classify as malicious traffic</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Some Interesting Observations</p>
    <p>Damage is done at the time existing solutions can help  Existing detection &amp; mitigation require the attack to be in progress</p>
    <p>Only way forward (our goal) is to prevent attack from happening</p>
    <p>Well known that prevention is best near the source of the attack</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Edge Computing</p>
    <p>The Edge (Cellular Base stations, Enterprise, Personal)</p>
    <p>Lower Latency</p>
    <p>IoTIoTIoT</p>
    <p>Lower Backhaul Bandwidth</p>
    <p>Lower Cost</p>
    <p>Edge Functions</p>
    <p>Data centers</p>
    <p>Confidential</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Can Edge Computing Help?</p>
    <p>Edge infrastructure is closest to the source of IoT-DDoS  A new vantage point for IoT-DDoS prevention</p>
    <p>BUT</p>
    <p>A single edge location (function) has limited visibility  To be able to detect a IoT-DDoS</p>
    <p>Edge infrastructure at a location has constrained resources  To be able to mitigate a IoT-DDoS</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Key Idea</p>
    <p>Only if all edge functions could inform a centralized service about the attack</p>
    <p>faster than attack itself using minimal resources</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>ShadowNet System Overview</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Design Elements</p>
    <p>Realizing fast-path for ShadowNet  Leveraging HW (network slicing) and SW mechanisms (lower protocol distance)</p>
    <p>Designing scalable ShadowNet service  Preferably over connection-less, response-less sink for shadow packets over fastpath</p>
    <p>Enabling efficient deployment of prevention and mitigation  Detection algorithms at ShadowNet service &amp; just-in-time deployment</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Up to 10x faster detection prevents 82% damage</p>
    <p>Setup: VMs on GENI platform with Openvswitch &amp; sFlow monitoring</p>
    <p>Attacks generated using Bonesi: 252 attackers per edge function</p>
    <p>Bandwidth overhead UDP: 4.76 Mbps (0.62s), HTTP: 280 Kbps (2.46s)</p>
    <p>Resource overhead: +3.15% CPU, no perceivable memory overhead</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Q /A, Feedback and Limitations</p>
    <p>Generalization of the idea: Knowing something before it happens  a unique and new property in networked systems</p>
    <p>Other potential use cases (?)  Faster ML inference/analytics, Faster perceived web page loading,</p>
    <p>The Achilles heal: fast-path effectiveness</p>
