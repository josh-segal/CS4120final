    <p>Conclusion and future work</p>
    <p>Conclusion  Build ExpansionNet to incorporate short phrases, product title and</p>
    <p>aspect preference in review generation  Show aspect embedding and aspect extraction can be used in</p>
    <p>personalized text generation</p>
    <p>Future work  Combine text expansion task with text rewriting techniques  Generate longer text such as product recommendation articles</p>
