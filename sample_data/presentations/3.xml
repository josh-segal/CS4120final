    <p>Why is my classifier getting worse over time?</p>

    <p>Why is my classifier getting worse?</p>
    <p>The data distribution has changed Is there anything systematic about how it changes? Is there anything we can do to adapt to temporal changes?</p>
    <p>Subtle shifts in topic distribution</p>
    <p>Declining performance</p>

    <p>Experiments</p>
    <p>Two types of time periods: Seasonal</p>
    <p>Repeat across years (e.g., time of year)</p>
    <p>Non-seasonal  No repetition (e.g., spans of years)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <p>Experiments</p>
    <p>Binary classification  Logistic regression, n-gram features</p>
    <p>Six datasets, each grouped into 4-6 time periods</p>

    <p>RQ1: How does performance vary?</p>
    <p>Analysis:  Train and test on each time period</p>
    <p>Measure how performance drops when the test period is different</p>
    <p>Balanced so each time period has same # of documents</p>

    <p>Takeaways: This type of analysis can reveal characteristics of corpus Unanswered: why does performance vary?</p>

    <p>RQ2: Can we adapt to temporal variations?</p>
    <p>Idea: Address this as a domain adaptation problem Treat explicitly-defined time periods as domains</p>

    <p>Approach: Feature augmentation method from Daum III (2007)</p>

    <p>RQ2: Can we adapt to temporal variations?</p>
    <p>How to use in non-seasonal settings?  Separately weigh domain-specific features</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>RQ2: Can we adapt to temporal variations?</p>
    <p>How to use in non-seasonal settings?  During training: weigh domain-specific features differently  Can also combine with seasonal domains</p>
    <p>3 copies of each feature (general, year-specific, season-specific)</p>
    <p>Simulating performance on future data:  Train in initial time periods  Tune on second-to-last period  Test on final time period</p>

    <p>Takeaways: Simple-to-implement adaptation can make classifiers more robust across time</p>
    <p>Suggestion: tune hyperparameters on heldout data from the chronological end of your corpus (cf. cross-validation)  Can lead to better performance on future data</p>
