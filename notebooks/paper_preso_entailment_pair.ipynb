Equilibrium is a static concept that often abstracts away the question of how it is reached. Once we start looking at dynamics, or at algorithms for finding equilibria, we cannot escape questions of the form \"How is an equilibrium reached?\". While there can be different formalizations of this question, in most cases, a truly satisfactory answer would have each player performing only simple \"locally rational\" actions and yet, mysteriously, the system would reach a global equilibrium. The simplest example of such phenomena is repeated best-response dynamics: each player selects the best (locally optimal) response to what others are currently doing, and this process goes on \"for a while\" until it \"converges\" to what must be a (pure Nash) equilibrium. Convergence of repeated bestresponse is, unfortunately, not guaranteed in general, and is the subject of much research, as is the convergence of more sophisticated \"locallyrational\" dynamics, e.g., fictitious play or regret minimization.</p><p>Our focus in this paper is on a different question that has received little attention so far: \"Is such locally rational behavior really rational?\". Specifically, we consider games in which repeated best-response dynamics do converge to an equilibrium and study the incentive properties of this process: Is it rational for players to repeatedly bestrespond? Can a long-sighted player improve, in the long run, over this repeated myopic optimization?</p><p>These questions about incentives are best explored in the context of games with incomplete information. Switching our attention from games with complete information to games with uncoupled incomplete information, we see that repeated best-response exhibits another attractive trait: to best-respond each player need only know his own utility function (\"type\"), as his best response does not depend on other players\\' utility functions, but only on their actions. Thus, we can view bestresponse dynamics as a natural protocol for gradual and limited sharing of information in an effort to reach an equilibrium. Indeed, in many real-life contexts the interaction between decision makers with incomplete information takes the form of best-response dynamics (e.g., Internet routing <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">[7]</ref>). When regarding best-response dynamics from this perspective, it is an indirect mechanism in the private-information mechanism-design sense. We wish to understand when such a mechanism, that dictates that all players repeatedly best-respond, is incentive compatible.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"1.2\">The Setting</head><p>Let us begin by laying out our setting for studying and formalizing incentives for repeated bestresponse. In our framework, each player holds a private utility function, and all players\\' utility functions, when put together, determine a fullinformation base game with some commonlyknown strategy spaces. We desire that the outcome of the dynamics be an equilibrium of this base game.</p><p>Base game: We are given an n-player (one-shot) base game G, with players 1, . . . , n, in which each player i has strategy space S i , and S = S 1 × ... × S n . Each player i has a utility function u i such that (u 1 , . . . , u n ) ∈ U ⊆ U 1 × · · · × U n , where U i ⊆ ℜ |S| is player i\\'s utility space. Each player knows only his own utility function, i.e., we view u i itself as player i\\'s type.</p><p>Best-response mechanisms: We study a class of indirect mechanisms, that we term \"repeatedresponse mechanisms\": players take turns selecting strategies; at each (discrete) time step t, some player i t selects and announces strategy s t i ∈ S it . Observe that one course of action available to each player in a repeated-response mechanism is to always choose a best-response to the most recently announced strategies of the others, that is, repeated-best-response. We call a repeated-response mechanism in which the prescribed behavior for each player is to repeatedly best-respond a \"best-response mechanism\". To fully-specify a best-response mechanism we must specify (1) the starting state; (2) the order of player activations (which player is \"active\" when); and (3) for each player, a rule for breaking ties among multiple best responses. All of our results hold regardless of the initial state and of the order of players\\' activations (so long as it is \"long enough\"), and, in fact, even in more general settings. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b0\">1</ref> We discuss tie-breaking rules below.</p><p>Goal: Our general aim is to identify interesting classes of (base) games for which best-response mechanisms are incentive-compatible.</p><p>Intuitively, a best-response mechanism is incentivecompatible if, when all other players are repeatedly best-responding, then a player is incentivized to do the same. Defining incentive compatibility in our setting involves many intricacies. We opt to focus here on a very general notion of incentive compatibility that, we believe, captures essentially any variant that the reader may desire; in a companion paper <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">[11]</ref>, we present several more games (auctions) where only strictly weaker notions of incentive compatibility can be obtained. Our notion of incentive compatibility here captures the two following distinct but complementary points of view: a mechanism design perspective and a learning equilibrium <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b0\">[1,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">2]</ref> perspective.</p><p>Mechanism design perspective (in a prior-free non-Bayesian setting): This point of view is natural when analyzing finite-time protocols in computerized and economic settings. We are given a game with incomplete information G, where each player\\'s utility function is private, and we wish to implement a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) of G. We point out that this uncommon objectiveimplementing an equilibrium-proves to be a natural implementation goal in many contexts (see Section 3, where we show that desirable outcomes can be regarded as \"stable states\"). Best-response mechanisms are incentive compatible, from this perspective, if the desired outcomes are implemented in the ex-post Nash sense 2 . Importantly, from this point of view, no actual play happens during the process of best-response dynamics and players merely announce strategies as their communication with the mechanism; each player only cares about maximizing his benefit from the final outcome of the mechanism, that is expected to ter-1 Our results actually hold even for (1) asynchronous player activation orders in which multiple players can best-respond simultaneously or based on outdated information (as studied in <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">[12]</ref>); (2) adaptive player activation orders that can change based on the history of play; and also when (3) the mechanism terminates as soon as all players \"pass\", that is, each player repeats his last strategy. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">2</ref> The Revelation Principle then implies that the direct revelation mechanism is truthful (in the ex-post-nash sense). minate after some finite predetermined number of time steps.</p><p>Learning equilibrium perspective: This point of view is natural when analyzing environments such as Internet protocols and global financial transactions, where players repeatedly interact with each other and there is no \"final turn\". Now, the players are actually involved in infinite repeated play of the incomplete-information game G and each player has a rule for selecting his next strategy based on the history of play. We are interested in the natural rule that dictates that a player simply always best-respond to others\\' most-recent strategies. In this context, each player wishes to maximize his long-term payoff, that we model to be the lim sup of his stage utilities in this infinitely-played game 3 . Best-response mechanisms are incentive compatible, from this perspective, if the \"best-response\" rules are themselves in equilibrium in this infinite game regardless of the realization of (u 1 , . . . , u n ). Using the terminology of <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b0\">[1,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">2]</ref>, this means that best-response dynamics are in \"learning equilibrium\". We stress that this would not follow from the folk theorem since our players do not, in any way, punish other players for deviation. To the contrary, our incentive compatibility results establish that the natural best-response dynamics are in equilibrium without requiring players to be able to detect and penalize other players\\' deviations.</p><p>Tie-breaking rules.</p><p>When multiple bestresponses exist we must specify, for each player, a tie-breaking rule. Importantly, this tie-breaking rule must be \"uncoupled\", i.e., depend solely on the player\\'s private information (utility function) and not on information that is unavailable to him 4 . Our tie-breaking rules always have the following simple form: fix, for each player i, an a-priori full order ≺ i on S i (that can depend on u i ), and instruct player i to break ties between multiple best-responses according to ≺ i . While this might seem innocent enough, we do get significant milage from delicate choices of these tie-breaking rules, to the point that one may desire an intuitive justification for these choices. Roughly speaking, there are two main, conflicting, intuitions: in some cases we simply ask players to break ties so as to be \"nice\" to others; in other cases we break ties according to some \"iterated-trembling-hand\" logic.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"1.3\">Games with Incentive-Compatible BestResponse Mechanisms</head><p>Our main results are identifying a class of games for which best-response mechanisms are incentive compatible, and exhibiting several interesting games that fall within this class (and thus have incentive-compatible best-response mechanisms). While at first glance, it might seem that the existence of a unique PNE to which best-response dynamics are guaranteed to converge implies the incentive-compatibility of best-response mechanisms, this intuition is false. Observe that in this game, (B, D) is the unique PNE and every sequence of best responses converges to it. Yet, consider the scenario that the starting point is the strategy profile (A, C), and the column player repeatedly best-responds. Clearly, the row player\\'s local improvement from (A, C) to (B, C) will lead to the column player moving to <ref type=\"bibr\">(B, D)</ref>. Hence, the row player can do better by looking ahead, not moving from (A, C), and thus \"getting stuck\" at (A, C), that he strictly prefers to the unique pure Nash (B, D). Hence, repeated best-responding is not incentive compatible in this game which is strictly-dominance-solvable, is a potential game, and has a unique and Paretooptimal PNE.</p><p>What traits must a game have for best-response dynamics to be incentive compatible?</p><p>We now present an intuitive exposition of a class of games for which this is achieved, which we term \"Never-Best-Response-Solvable (NBRsolvable) games with clear outcomes\". In an NBRsolvable game, strategies are iteratively eliminated if a best-response never leads to them (this is slightly different from dominance-solvability and shall be defined in the following section). Intuitively, an NBR-solvable game has a clear outcome if when each player i considers the game after the other players have already eliminated strategies that can be eliminated regardless of what i does, he can already tell that he will not be able to do better than the outcome that is reached via repeated best-response.</p><p>Our main, and quite easy to prove, general theorem is the following. (We now state the theorem for the case that the strategy spaces are finite, though our result also holds for infinite strategy spaces.)</p><p>Theorem (informal): Let G be an NBR-solvable game with a clear outcome. Then, for every starting point and every (finite or infinite) order of player activations with at least T = Σ i |S i | − n \"rounds\" (a round is a sequence of consecutive time steps in which each player is \"active\" at least once) it holds that:</p><p>1. Repeated best-response dynamics converges to a pure Nash equilibrium s * of G. 2. Repeated best-response dynamics is incentive compatible. We prove that each of the four environments below can be formulated as a game that falls within our class of games, and that the desired outcome in each environment translates to a PNE in this formulation. Thus, the above result implies the existence of incentive-compatible best-response mechanisms that implement the desired outcome in all the contexts below.</p><p>• Stable-roommates. In this classic setting <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">[3]</ref>, students must be paired for the purpose of sharing dorm rooms, and each student has a private full order over possible roommates.</p><p>The objective is to find a \"stable matching\" where no two students prefer each other to their assigned roommates. We show that a natural mechanism, in which a student repeatedly proposes to his most preferred roommate among those that would not immediately reject him, and immediately rejects all proposers except for his most preferred proposer, is incentive compatible in well-studied environments (interns-hospitals, correlated markets).</p><p>• Cost-sharing. Cost-sharing arises in situations in which the cost of some public service (e.g., building a bridge) must be distributed between self-interested users that can benefit from this service to different extents. We present a distributed mechanism that achieves this goal in an incentive-compatible manner.</p><p>Our mechanism implements the outcome of the famous Moulin mechanism <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">[9,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">10]</ref> (this result can be extended to the more general class of \"acyclic mechanisms\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">[8]</ref>).</p><p>• Internet routing. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) establishes routes between the smaller networks that make up the Internet.</p><p>We abstract the results in <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">[7]</ref> and prove that BGP is incentive compatible in realistic environments.</p><p>• Congestion control. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) handles congestion on the Internet. Building upon <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ref>, that models key aspects of TCP, we consider behavior that is somewhat similar to TCP: increase your attempted transmission rate until encountering congestion, and then decrease the transmission rate. We show that such behavior is in equilibrium. Our results above establish incentive compatibility of best-response mechanisms. We also consider the stronger \"collusion-proofness\" desideratum, that even a coalition of players not be able to deviate from repeated best-response and all strictly gain from doing so. We prove that in some of the above environments best-response mechanisms even achieve this stronger requirement.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"1.4\">Research Agenda</head><p>We view this work as a first step towards a more general research agenda. While convergence to equilibrium of \"locally-rational\" dynamics, e.g., repeated best-response, fictitious play and regret minimization, has been extensively studied, little attention has been given to the question of when such locally-rational dynamics are also \"globally rational\". Here, we tackle this question in the context of repeated best-response and the implementation of PNE. However, we believe that the examination of other dynamics (e.g., fictitious play, regret minimization) and other kinds of equilibria (e.g., mixed Nash equilibrium, correlated equilibrium) is an interesting direction for future research.</p><p>Positive and negative results along these lines can help shed new light on the incentive structure of existing protocols/mechanisms (see our results for BGP and TCP and the results in <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">7]</ref>), and provide new insights into the design of new protocols/mechanisms.</p><p>Our results for repeated best-response dynamics establish sufficient conditions for repeated bestresponse to be incentive compatible. We still lack characterizations of conditions that imply incentive compatibility both for general games and for specific classes of games (dominance-solvable games, potential games, etc.). We have thus far considered a very strong notion of incentive compatibility. We believe that considering more restrictive notions (e.g., incentive compatibility in expectation) is of interest. Indeed, in a companion paper <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">[11]</ref> we present several such results for commerce environments.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"1.5\">Organization</head><p>In the next section we formalize our model and present our general theorem.

Then, there exists a sequence of games G 0 , . . . , G r with length r = e G , such that G = G 0 , in G r each player has only a single strategy, and ∀i ∈ {0, . . . , r − 1}, G i+1 is obtained from G i via the removal of sets of NBR strategies (under tiebreaking).</p><p>Convergence: We first show that if all players repeatedly best-respond then convergence to a PNE is guaranteed within e G rounds. Consider the first round of a best-response mechanism, and consider some j ∈ [n] such that there exists s j ∈ S j that is NBR in G = G 0 . Observe that once j is activated for the first time, s j will never be selected thereafter. Thus, after the first round, no NBR strategy in G 0 will be played ever again and hence the game is effectively equivalent to G 1 . We can now use the same argument to show that after the second round the game is effectively equivalent to G 2 . Thus, we mimic the elimination sequence in each strategy until we end up at G r , whose unique strategy tuple s * is the unique PNE under tie-breaking of G.</p><p>Incentive compatibility: this property follows from the fact that when each player i considers the game after the other players have already eliminated dominated strategies that can be eliminated regardless of what i does, he can already tell that he will not be able to do better than the outcome that is reached via repeated best-response.</p><p>We give the precise argument (by contradiction). Let i be a player that deviates from repeated best-response and strictly gains from doing so. The fact that G is NBR-solvable with a clear outcome (under tie-breaking) implies that there exists a (player-specific) order of elimination of NBR strategies (under the given tie-breaking rules) such that s * is globally optimal for i at the first step in the elimination sequence in which a strategy in S i is eliminated (that is, in the game obtained after the removal of all previously-eliminated strategies from G). Consider this order of elimination; it induces some sequence of games G 0 , . . . , G l such that G = G 0 , in G l each player has only a single strategy, and ∀i ∈ {0, . . . , l − 1}, G i+1 is obtained from G i via the removal of sets of NBR strategies (under tie-breaking) as in the (i + 1)\\'th step in that order. Now, let t i be the index of the first game in the sequence in which i\\'s strategies are eliminated in that order. All players but i are repeatedly bestresponding and in the t i − 1 first steps of the elimination sequence no strategy in S i is eliminated. We can use the same arguments that we used to show convergence, to show that after t i − 1 rounds the game is effectively equivalent to G ti , regardless of the actions of player i. However, in that game, i can do no better than s * -a contradiction.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3\">Four Best-Response Mechanisms</head><p>We present four examples of environments that can be formulated as games that are NBRsolvable with clear outcomes (sometimes under tie-breaking): stable-roommates games, costsharing games, BGP games and TCP games. This implies the existence of incentive-compatible bestresponse mechanisms for all these environments.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.1\">Stable-Roommates</head><p>This following classic setting has been extensively studied in economics, game theory and computer science. n students 1, . . . , n must be paired for the purpose of sharing dorm rooms. Each student has a private strict ranking of the others, and prefers being matched to not being matched. The goal is to find a stable matching, i.e., a matching where no two students prefer each other to their matched roommates. Unfortunately, a stable matching is not guaranteed to exist in general and, furthermore, even if a stable matching does exist (e.g., in bipartite graphs), existing algorithms for reaching it are not incentive compatible <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">[3]</ref>. We seek environments where a stable matching is guaranteed to exist and can be reached in an incentive compatible manner. We focus on two wellknown special cases of stable roommates:</p><p>• Intern-hospital matchings: The \"students\" are divided into two disjoint sets, called interns and hospitals, and all hospitals have the same ranking of interns (e.g., GPA-based).</p><p>• Correlated markets: The \"students\" are vertices in a complete graph in which every edge has a unique \"weight\". The \"heavier\" the edge connecting a student to another student the higher that student ranks the other student. We now show how the framework in Section 2 can be used to design natural incentive compatible mechanisms for stable-roommates. We first formulate this environment as a game and prove that this game is NBR-solvable with a clear outcome.</p><p>Stable-roommates games: The students are the players and each student i\\'s strategy space S i is the set of all students j ̸ = i. α i (j) denotes student j\\'s rank in student i\\'s ranking (the least desired roommate\\'s rank is 1). ∀s = (s 1 , . . . , s n ) ∈ S (that is, choices of roommates), u i (s) = α i (j) iff s i = j and k ̸ = i such that s k = j and α j (k) &gt; α j (i); otherwise, u i (s) = 0. 5 (Observe that players\\' utilities are correlated.)</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Theorem 3.1 For every stable-roommates game G it holds that in both hospital-intern matchings and correlated markets</head><p>• G is NBR-solvable.</p><p>• G\\'s unique PNE is a stable matchings.</p><p>• e G ≤ n.</p><p>Proof sketch: We say that a stable-roommates game is cycle-free if there is no sequence of roomates r 1 , r 2 , . . . r k of length k &gt; 2 such that each student r i ranks student r i+1 higher than student r i−1 (where student indices are considered mod k to induce a cycle). Any matching game that is cycle-free has an elimination sequence that can be constructed as follows: At any stage in the elimination start with some arbitrary student r 1 (that has more than one strategy in the current subgame) and construct a sequence r 1 , r 2 , . . . of students in which r i+1 is the student r i prefers the most out of the students that still have more than one possible strategy remaining (other strategies were eliminated). The number of students is finite and so the sequence must repeat. Since the game is cycle free, the cycle must be of length 2. We have thus located 2 students that desire each other the most. We can eliminate for each of the two the strategies of proposing to any other student since they are guaranteed to gain the maximal utility by proposing to each other.</p><p>All that remains is to notice that both the hospital-intern game and the correlated markets game are cycle-free. In the case of hospitals and interns, the hospitals agree about the ranking of interns and so any cycle of players will have to include a hospital that is placed after a desired intern and before a less desired one. In the case of correlated markets, any cycle of nodes in the graph must include an edge with a lower weight that appears after an edge with a higher one and therefore the preferences do not induce a cycle in the matching graph in either case.</p><p>We observe that the following simple and computationally-efficient mechanism is a bestresponse mechanism for stable-roommate games, and so Theorem 2.7 implies that it implements a stable matching in an incentive-compatible manner.</p><p>Mechanism for Stable-Roommates:</p><p>• Go over the students in some cyclic (roundrobin) order and, at each time step, allow a single student to announce another student.</p><p>• We say that a student i makes a \"better offer\" to another student j at time t if (1) i announces j at time t; and (2) j prefers i to all students from whom he has \"offers\", that is, all students whose last announcement was j.</p><p>The mechanism prescribes that each student repeatedly check which students he can make a better offer to, and announce his most preferred student to whom he can make a better offer.</p><p>• The mechanism terminates after n 2 steps and outputs all student pairs (i, j) such that i\\'s last announcement was j and j\\'s last announcement was i.</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_1\">Theorem 3.2</formula><p>The mechanism is incentivecompatible in ex-post Nash and implements a stable matching in both intern-hospital matchings and correlated markets.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.2\">Cost-Sharing</head><p>Cost-sharing arises in situations in which the cost of some public service (e.g., building a bridge) must be distributed between self-interested users that can benefit from this service to different extents, and is modeled as follows. n users 1, . . . , n aim to share the cost of building some common infrastructure. Some cost-sharing rule specifies, for every subset of users S, and every user i ∈ S, i\\'s \"cost share\" c i (S) for building an infrastructure that only serves members of S. c i (S) is nonnegative, monotonically non-increasing in S, and also cross-monotonic, that is, ∀i ∈ S ⊆ T , c i (S) ≥ c i (T ). User i gets positive (private) value v i ∈ ℜ ≥0 if the infrastructure serves him and 0 otherwise. The goal is to split the cost of the infrastructure between a group of users so that each user\\'s payment is at least his cost-share, yet does not exceed his private value, that is, to find \"reasonable\" cost shares. Moulin <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">[9]</ref> exhibits a centralized mechanism that achieves this (see also <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">[10]</ref>).</p><p>We now use the framework in Section 2 to design simple and natural distributed incentivecompatible mechanisms that implement the same outcome as the Moulin mechanism.

First, notice that each player can only get a non-positive utility from a bid that is above his valuation. We therefore start by eliminating these bids for all players. Next, let R v be the set of serviced users for bids that are exactly the valuations of the players. Any player i / ∈ R v will not get serviced for any set of bids that are in the remaining subgame (costs only increase as players drop out and he does not win when they all pay the maximal amount). We can therefore eliminate all strategies below v i for any such player. For every player j ∈ R v , we can eliminate all bids below c j (R v ), as he will only get 0 utility with those bids, and non-negative utility with higher bids. Once these are eliminated, then in the remaining subgame R v will always be the serviced set of players and we can eliminate all bids above c j (R v ) as well.</p><p>Note that it is also possible to perform the eliminations using a different order. Specifically, for each player i we can let all other players eliminate bids above v, then determine a set of serviced agents R i for the case in which every agent j bids v j except for agent i that bids ∞. Then, eliminate all bids for non-serviced agents (except their valuation), and check if c i (R i ) is greater than v i . If it is, we can eliminate bids below c i (R i ) for agent i. Otherwise, agent i will not gain a positive utility from the service in any case and we can eliminate all his strategies except his valuation. We can then continue along the same lines as before and eliminate strategies for all other players. Either way, the elimination done by agent i leads to a subgame in which s * is the optimal outcome for him, and so the game has a clear outcome as required.</p><p>We observe that the following natural distributed mechanism is a best-response mechanism for 1 st -price cost-sharing games (under these tiebreaking rules), and so Theorem 2.7 implies that it implements the outcome of the Moulin mechanism in an incentive-compatible manner.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Mechanism for Cost-Sharing:</head><p>• Go over the users in some cyclic (roundrobin) order and, at each time step, allow a single user to submit a bid in ℜ ≥0 .</p><p>• The mechanism prescribes that each bidder i repeatedly bid as follows: submit the minimal bid b i ≤ v i such that i is in the serviced set for the most-recently submitted bids; in the event that no such bid exists submit the bid b i = v i .</p><p>• The mechanism terminates after n 2 time steps, outputs the serviced set S for the lastsubmitted bids and charges each bidder i ∈ S his last bid b i .</p><formula xml:id=\"formula_4\">Theorem 3.4</formula><p>The mechanism is incentive compatible and implements reasonable cost-shares.</p><p>This result can be extended to the class of acyclic mechanisms studied in <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">[8]</ref>).</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.3\">Internet Routing</head><p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) establishes routes between the smaller networks that make up the Internet. Griffin et al. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b5\">[6]</ref> put forth the following model for analyzing BGP dynamics. The network is an undirected graph G = (V, E) where the vertex set V consists of n source nodes and 1, . . . , n a unique destination node d. Each source node has a private strict ranking of all simple (loop-free) routes between itself and the destination node d. Under BGP, each source node repeatedly examines its neighboring nodes\\' most recent route-announcements, selects to forward traffic through the neighbor whose route it likes the most, and announces its newly chosen route to all neighbors via update messages.

At every stage in the elimination, we locate a node that can guarantee its most preferred route (in the current subgame) and eliminate all other routing actions for it. To show that such a node always exists, we begin with an arbitrary node a 0 with at least 2 actions. Let R 0 be a 0 \\'s most preferred existing route to d (a route is said to exist if all nodes along it can route accordingly in the current subgame). Let a 1 be the vertex closest to d on R 0 , with two available actions in the current subgame, such that a 1 prefers some other route R 1 to the suffix of R 0 that leads from a 1 to d (if no such node exists a 0 can guarantee its most preferred route). Then we choose a 2 to be the vertex closest to d on R 1 such that a 2 \\'s most preferred route R 2 is preferred over the suffix of R 1 that leads from a 2 to d. Once again if there is no such a 2 we are done. We can continue to choose a 3 , a 4 , . . . in the same manner. Since there is a finite number of vertices, at some point some vertex will appear twice in this sequence (a 0 , a 1 , . . .). This would result in the formation of a Dispute Wheel (in which the a i s are the pivot nodes and the R i s are the routes) which we assumed is not contained in the graph. We will therefore always be able to find a node that can guarantee its most preferred route and continue with the elimination, until there are no more nodes with several possible actions.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"3.4\">Congestion Control</head><p>Congestion control is a crucial task in communication networks. Congestion is handled via the combination of transmission-rate-adjustment protocols at the sender-receiver level (e.g., TCP), and queueing management policies at the router level, that dictate how excess traffic is discarded (e.g., RED). TCP is notoriously not incentive compatible. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ref> analyzes incentives in the following TCPinspired environment. The network is an undirected graph G = (V, E) with a given a capacity function c that specifies the capacity c(e) for each edge e ∈ E. The network consists of n sourcetarget pairs of vertices (α i , β i ). Every such sourcetarget pair (α i , β i ) aims to send traffic along a fixed route R i in G. Each source α i can select transmission rates that lie in the interval <ref type=\"bibr\">[0, M i ]</ref>, where M i is α i \\'s private information, and wishes to maximize its achieved throughput. When an edge encounters congestion, that is, the sum of incoming flows traversing it exceeds its capacity, excess traffic must be discarded. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ref> considers two capacityallocation schemes:</p><p>• Strict-Priority-Queueing (SPQ). ∀e ∈ E there is an edge-specific order over source nodes. Capacity is shared as follows: the most highly ranked source whose route traverses the edge gets its entire flow sent along the edge (up to c(e)); unused capacity is allocated to the second most highly ranked source whose route traverses the edge in a similar fashion, etc.</p><p>• Weighted-Fair-Queueing (WFQ). ∀e ∈ E, each source node α i has weight w i (e) at e. Every source α i is then allocated capacity wi Σj wj c(e). Unused capacity is allocated in a recursive manner. The special case that ∀e ∈ E, ∀i ∈ [n], w i (e) = 1 is called \"fair queueing\" (FQ).</p><p>[5] considers a TCP-like protocol called Probing-Increase-Educate-Decrease (PIED) in which each source is instructed to gradually increase its transmission rate until encountering congestion and, at that point, decrease its transmission rate to its achieved throughput. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ref> analyzes PIED in settings in which all edges use SPQ or all edges use WFQ, and sources priorities/weights are identical on all edges. PIED is shown to be incentive compatible in both these environments (also under asynchronous timings of rate-transmission adjustments). It is interesting to notice that PIED can be considered a form of better-response in a setting in which the exact available capacity is unknown. We unify the two results above for an abstracted setting by formulating the environment in <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ref> as a game and showing that this game is NBR-solvable with a clear outcome (under specific tie-breaking rules). Our main difference from <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ref> is that we allow players more knowledge about the network, while <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ref> uses the probing nature of PIED to learn the needed information (all that is needed is for players to be able to tell the amount of available bandwidth on their path). Thus, Theorem 2.7 implies a result that is similar in spirit to the two theorems in <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ref>.</p><p>TCP games: The source nodes are the players and each source node i\\'s strategy space is S i = [0, M i ]. Given a vector of source nodes\\' transmission rates (strategies) − → r = (r 1 , . . . , r n ), u i ( − → r ) is α i \\'s achieved throughput in the unique trafficflow equilibrium point of the network for − → r ( <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">[5]</ref> shows that such a unique equilibrium point exists for the SPQ and WFQ settings with coordinated priorities/weights).</p><p>Tie-breaking rules: ∀s, t ∈ S i , s ≺ i t iff s &gt; t. • e G ≤ n.</p><p>For clarity of presentation we show only the proof for the case of Weighted-Fair-Queueing, with equal weights. The proof for non-equal weights and for Strict-Priority-Queueing follow similar lines. Proof sketch: Let us define for each edge e, the share of each flow as β e = c e /k e where k e is the number of flows that traverse the edge. We construct an elimination sequence for the game as follows: Let e * be the edge with the minimal β. Each flow on this edge is guaranteed β e * traffic through that edge, and at least that amount on all other edges. It is therefore possible to eliminate all actions of transmitting less than β e * for each player that goes through e * . Now, if all flows through e * claim their fair share, no flow can send more (no bandwidth is unclaimed). We can therefore eliminate all actions of transmitting above β e * for these flows. Now, we are left with a subgame with a smaller number of active players where some of the bandwidth on each edge is already used up. We can now repeat the elimination steps for the residual network graph with the remaining players.</p><p>Notice that for each bottleneck edge e * that is found along the process there are several orders of elimination (according to ordering among players). If player i eliminates actions below β e * last among players that go through e * , then he does so in a game in which the final profile is optimal for him, and so the game has a clear outcome.</p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head n=\"4\">Collusion-Proof Best-Response Mechanisms</head><p>In Section 3, we establish incentive compatibility results for four environments. We are able to strengthen our results for stable-roommates (Theorem 3.1), BGP games (Theorem 3.6), and TCP games where all edges use SPQ with coordinated priorities (see Theorem 3.9). We prove that, in all these settings, best-response mechanisms are actually also collusion-proof. We observe, though, that NBR-solvability with a clear outcome does not imply collusion-proofness of best-response mechanisms in general. To see this, consider the game depicted in <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_3\">Figure 3</ref> (which is simply the prisoner\\'s dilemma).</p><p>Observe that this game is indeed an NBRsolvable game with a clear outcome, yet both players prefer (C, C) to the unique equilibrium (D, D).
